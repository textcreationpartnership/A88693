         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:170420:6"/>his calumnies; which will not be faſtened on your Names, how ever they might more eaſily have ſtained mine, if I had been ſingly beſpattered by him. Yet in making this advantage of your company under his abuſes, I do not in the leaſt attempt, to ſhelter the weakneſſes and defects of my paper, or its defence, under the covert of your protection. The interpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of you in theſe lines, deſigneth only a publique teſtimony of the precious eſteeme I have of you, whoſe unanimous and ſtudious perſevering in the work of the Lord (notwithſtanding the ſad and never too much lamented loſſe we have lately ſuſtained in the deceaſe of that paire of moſt grave, venerable and unblemiſht Divines, as alſo of a third, though not ſo ancient, yet very uſefull and able Miniſter, who were lately the ſtrength and ornament. the Horſemen and Chariots, not only of our Claſſis, but County and Province alſo; I ſay, notwithſtanding this diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, your continued pious endeavours together and apart) are and ſhall be no leſſe the joy of many, then they ſeeme to be the envy of ſome.</p>
            <p>And you my much honoured Fathers and Brethren in the Miniſtry of this County, I cannot omit in this Dedication, as having been moved by many of you to the work here undertaken, which now I humbly lay at your feet; obliging my ſelfe to be thankfull for any of your learned faithfull Animadverſions, you may be pleaſed to afford me, in what I may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by any of you to have erred: aſſuring you that ſuch oyle (if not inflamed with paſſion) ſhall be of moſt precious account with mee for the healing the wounds you may diſcerne in my head.</p>
            <p>This Controverſie which ſome have enlarged by the introducing of many things not concluſive here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:170420:6"/>is here reduced to this point; wherein, indeed the ſtreſs lyes, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the word of God gives any warrant to adminiſter either to ſuch as are viſibly in the wayes of wickedneſſe, inconſiſtent with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of juſtifying faith? Or to ſuch as have not in their own perſons underſtandingly, and before competent witneſſes, profeſſed their owning of their baptiſmal engagements, which in their infancy were layd upon them? In this the whole controverſie is contained; the former being aſſerted and proved eſtabliſheth ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, the latter non-Admiſſion, as is ſhewed in the third Digreſſion about Examination. All acknowledge beleevers only have right to the Lords Supper. But then the Queſtion will be, whether all beleevers who are ſo called in any ſenſe, particularly in regard of their having been baptized, and poſitively engaged to beleeve? This cannot be granted, for then no Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, though excommunicate, could be debarred of neceſſity, therefore we muſt allow ſome qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neceſſary, to make one capable of the Sacrament, over and beſides his baptiſme, and having been poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively engaged to the Chriſtian faith. And this the Brethren for generall admiſſion ſeeme to confeſſe, when they in ſtating the Queſtion ſtill limit it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons adult and intelligent, and that in reſpect of the uſuall exerciſe of underſtanding, and actuall freedome from drunknneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which ſhould make them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of exerciſing reaſon during their intoxication. Their Antagoniſts have often urged them to give a Reaſon, why theſe may be debarred who have not the foreſaid qualifications, and not the notoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane? It hath been anſwered: 1. In reſpect of the drunk, that they are fit for no ordinance, and ſo not for the Lords Supper; which is a ſatisfactory Anſwer
<pb facs="tcp:170420:7"/>in it ſelfe. But not upon their principles, who 1 plead for an actual right in all to receive whoſe duty it is to receive; and 2. that Church-memberſhip entitles (or proves a title) to all Ordinances in the Church. For the drunken Chriſtian is not diſobliged from his duty in reference to this or other ordinance, nor diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, by his drunkenneſſe at preſent. 2. In reference to <hi>Minors,</hi> and the <hi>unintelligent,</hi> as to the ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of Reaſon; it is anſwered, that they come not under the command to receive, as being innocently unable to examine themſelves; but the prophane are unfit only through their own fault: and ſo they ſay, there is as much difference between theſe, as betwixt [will not] and [cannot]; the latter excuſeth, not the former. This I confeſſe is ſomewhat, but it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the matter wherein the knot lyes. For the Queſtion is not intended only, why <hi>Minors</hi> and the <hi>unintelligent</hi> are ſecluded from the Lords Supper? (to which the Reaſon given is an Anſwer.) But alſo, why they are ſecluded from the Lords Supper, when they are not ſecluded from other ordinances of publique prayers and preaching in the Church? And this the foreſaid Reaſon toucheth not. For if innocent incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as ſuch, excuſeth and ſo ſecludes from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would according to our Brethrens principles excuſe and ſeclude from other ordinances of equall ſanctity (as they ſpeake) and wherein as much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and other graces (they ſay) are neceſſary to be exerciſed to an acceptable performance, as in cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Lords Supper. And therefore the Reaſon of excluding the innocently uncapable from the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, will lye in this, becauſe they are viſibly <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable, in generall,</hi> as ſome prophane perſons may be; not in this <hi>in particular,</hi> that they are <hi>innocently</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable;
<pb facs="tcp:170420:7"/>And then the exception ſtands ſtill in force, <hi>viz.</hi> that they produce no Reaſon for debarring the <hi>unintelligent</hi> from the Sacrament, whiles they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to other Ordinances, which will not ſerve us for debarring the prophane from the Sacrament, though they are not debarred the prayers and hearing the word in the Church. But the Gentleman I have to deale with in this reply, ſeemes more liberall in this matter. For he deſcribes his <hi>poſitive beleever,</hi> that is, one who is poſitively obliged to Chriſtianity, who is with him capable of the Sacrament, by many other qualifications, <hi>p.</hi> 50, 51, 57. which I have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Treatiſe following, <hi>Ch.</hi> 8. §. 3. As 1. that he is one who is profeſſedly of the Chriſtian perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. (But what if he be an Arrian, is he no Chriſtian? then he is no heretique? ſo we are at a loſſe, how far this qualification will be extended, <hi>to be profeſſedly of the Chriſtian perſwaſion.</hi>) 2. That he frequent our Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblyes. 3. Heare our doctrine with reverence and attention. 4. Viſibly ſubmit to the outward meanes of reformation and amendment. 5. Not juſtifying his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages. 6 One who gives us viſible teſtimony of his aſſent to our doctrine. Now if the abſence of theſe render a perſon debarrable; It will not ſinke into my dul head, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or any one elſe can gratifie us with any ſcriptural Reaſon, for the ſame; (as to debar him who comes not to Church ordinarily,) which will not debar any prophane ſwearer, drunkard or unclean perſon, notoriouſly appearing ſo to be. And if any would favour me with a cleere Reaſon from Scripture, why an unintelligent perſon (though baptized adult, &amp;c.) may be debarred the Sacrament, as they hold he may, although not debarred other ordinances: I ſay if any would give me a proof of this, without mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb facs="tcp:170420:8"/>overturning thereby, the maine props of that ſtructure, which the Brethren for general Admiſſion have layd, I ſhall pawn my promiſe before you, to be much engaged for ſuch a diſcovery; which I muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe is not within the reach of my preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>There hath bin much ſpoken in the diſcuſſion of this ſubject, about polluting holy things, caſting pearles to ſwine, not diſtinguiſhing betwixt the precious and the vile, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the other party will I think yeeld are pertinent, if firſt it be proved, that the perſons pleaded for are unwarrantably admitted. And unleſſe this be ſoundly evinced, they who uſe thoſe paſſages muſt acknowledge they have no edge againſt their Antagoniſts. For certainly to diſpenſe Ordinances to them whom the word warrants us to diſpenſe them to, cannot juſtly be loaded with any of thoſe aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For Scripture is the Rule of purity. And ſo, on the other hand, the Arguments for the general admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contended for, taken from Chriſts command to adminiſter to Diſciples, Beleevers, that the Sacrament is a converting Ordinance (in ſome ſenſe) &amp;c. will, I ſuppoſe, be granted by thoſe who make uſe of them, to have no force againſt us, if this be once cleered to them, that the Diſciples and Beleevers to whom the Lords Supper belongs, are not all ſuch Diſciples or Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as are ſo called in reſpect of their profeſſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into Chriſts ſchool, and poſitive engagement to beleeve in him, (which no Apoſtate Arrian, nor Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan can looſe or put off from him) but thoſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are ſuch viſibly in regard of ſerving Chriſt and abiding in his wayes: the proving hereof is the deſigne of a maine part of the Treatiſe following. And though herein I may ſeeme too ſtrict; it may be I ſhall be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
<pb facs="tcp:170420:8"/>on the other hand, by ſome when they read how favourable my judgement is in the judging and diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning who are viſibly in a way of diſobedience inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the exerciſe of juſtifying faith. For there I thinke charity hath its place; not in widening the Rule, but in application of the Rule to particular perſons. But I ſhall not anticipate your peruſing the booke, (as you may have leaſure) by a tumultuary mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the contents thereof here. But I moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire your ſerious ſtudying the Queſtion, which is weighty and of practical continuall importance. And this I crave, not only in reference to your ſelves, and thoſe to whom you are guides in your particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, but alſo with ſome reſpect to my ſelfe, who may hope to receive benefit by the imparting your digeſted apprehenſions concerning this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For by a brotherly, private, impartial diſcuſſion of a controverted point, I ſhould think peaceable Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters from each other, may moſt probably and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually receive ſatisfaction; which then might be made publique (if they ſaw cauſe) by mutual conſent of both parties, all impertinencies and miſtakes on each hand diſcovered, being firſt lopt off. Whereas Diſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in print at the firſt daſh, are uſually full of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, and great Temptations to the Authours there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>From you therefore, my much honoured Fathers and Brethren, wherein any of you do or may diſſent from me, I ſhall readily receive rational correction. And if I approve my ſelfe to you truly ſtudious of truth (without bitterneſſe to ſuch as may be of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent judgement from me herein;) I ſhall have little cauſe to be ſollicitous about the <hi>Rejoynder</hi> to mee, which my Gentleman Publiſher hath already talked
<pb facs="tcp:170420:9"/>of, in his printed Apology. If he rationally convince me of the faultineſs of the main parts of my diſcourſe, I ſhall endeavour to let you and others know my ſenſe thereof: if not, you may conjecture by my ſilence. Controverſies muſt not be endleſſe; and I will not contend with him for a ſcowlds prize, to have the laſt word.</p>
            <p>Some of you and others may (perhaps) think this Treatiſe too long ere it came, and now too long when it is come forth.</p>
            <p>In reference to the latter, I deſire the weightineſſe of the ſubject, which in the main is treated upon, may be conſidered, and the neceſſity of taking in ſome extravagancies mine Antagoniſt had with much noyſe caſt in my way. At leaſt comparatively, I hope I ſhall be excuſed. For ſince Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſpent 9 ſheets in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my one; If I had taken a proportionable liberty, I ſhould have taken up 9 times 9 (81) in a reply to his. The like may be conſidered for ſome ſatisfaction to the former complaint. If thoſe monthes he had for his anſwer to my ſheet, be multiplyed by 9 times ſo many monthes, due to me for returning a reply to his nine, I ſhall be found much to have prevented the day I might have taken on that account. But its known to Divers, that I was long before I could be perſwaded to entertaine a reſolution for ſuch a buſineſſe, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how unhandſomly he had proceeded. And when I began to look more ſeriouſly on it, I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it was not quickly, that I could read his book without diſturbance; which neceſſitated me to lay it aſide, till I perceived my ſelfe compoſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe it calmely, as if I felt not my ſelfe ſcarce at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally concerned therein. And then the heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction which befell me <hi>June</hi> 1. 1657. (which I doubt
<pb facs="tcp:170420:9"/>not, many of you had a ſhare in) will eaſily be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by you a great diſcompoſure of my ſtudyes for ſuch a ſervice as this. I mention not my other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, ordinary and extraordinary. The Treatiſe was ready before <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and ſent up to <hi>London</hi> the week following. Let the reſt be imputed to my dulneſſe and ſlowneſſe, and if you will to (that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath ſpyed in me) my timorouſneſſe.</p>
            <p>I deferred the diſpatch of this Epiſtle till I ſaw ſome ſheets of the book printed, which I did not till the laſt week.</p>
            <p>¶ And now you will expect I ſhould ceaſe to be further troubleſome to you. And ſuch of you as are already tired, have the law in your own hands to help your ſelves by leaving off here if you pleaſe. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming that ſome of you will afford me your patience a little longer, I ſhall make bold (at the urgent requeſt of ſome whoſe judgement is not to be ſleighted) here to annex a ſhort diſcourſe concerning the privacy or publiqueneſſe of adminiſtring the other Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> of Baptiſme, which will not be unſutably joyned with the main ſubject of the diſcourſe following. And this challengeth its place here, becauſe it ſo particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly concernes the Miniſtry, and is therefore to be ſubmiſſively preſented to your ſerious conſideration, and candid cenſure. Let this then be the Queſtion to be diſcuſſed before you, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whether (or if at all in what caſes) Baptiſme may be now administred privately not publiquely?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>publique</hi> is ſometimes oppoſed in Scripture that which we render, from <hi>houſe to houſe,</hi> eſpecially in that text, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.20. But I humbly conceive the phraſe ſo rendred, <hi>viz.</hi>

<pb facs="tcp:170420:10"/>blamed by the Learned <hi>Beza.</hi> The phraſe and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance thereof is worth a ſtrict enquiry.

<pb facs="tcp:170420:10"/>and 2. becauſe here was not a reception of the people, friends &amp; foes promiſcuouſly (at leaſt not at all times) but of the brethren joyned together in eccleſiaſtical Chriſtian ſociety. For the cleering hereof I ſhall ſhew, 1. that this phraſe <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> in the N. T. (though ſundry times there uſed) is ever appropriated to the ſignifying of the Church meetings in their houſes; 2. And always (I take it) ſome other phraſe is uſed to denote ſuch as are in a meere private houſe. This latter may be ſeene in <hi>Act.</hi> 16.32. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>The Baptiſme of <hi>John</hi> was not privately adminiſtred, according to the ſenſes of <hi>private</hi> before mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.5, 6. <hi>Then went out unto him</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to the wilderneſs of <hi>Judea</hi>) <hi>Hieruſalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan confeſſing their ſins.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.5. <hi>And
<pb facs="tcp:170420:12"/>there went out unto him all the land of Judea, and they of Hieruſalem, and were all baptized of him in the river Jordan, confeſſing their ſins.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>And he preached, ſaying, there cometh one after me mightier then I,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 8. <hi>I indeed baptize you with water, but he with the holy Ghoſt Luke</hi> ſaith, Ch 3. ver. 2, 3. <hi>The word of God came to John in the wilderneſs, And he came into all the Country round about Jordan, preaching the Baptiſm of repentance for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>Then ſaith he to the multitude</hi> (which <hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith he ſaid to the Phariſees and Sadduces that came forth to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of him, <hi>Mat</hi> 3.7.) <hi>O generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> Its related, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.25, 28. <hi>They asked him why baptizeſt thou, if thou be not that Chriſt, nor Elias, neither that Prophet; John anſwered, I baptize you with water,</hi> &amp;c.— <hi>Theſe things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing,</hi> &amp;c. From this harmony we may obſerve, 1. That he baptized where he preached ordinarily, and as openly. 2. That multitudes came to him to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, to whom he preached, expoſtulating with them; and they confeſſed their ſins, when (probably before) they were baptized. Now this was not confeſſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>John</hi> alone, as our Divines ſhew againſt the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, who would hence inferre auricular confeſſion; but it rather was an open renouncing of former wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, as thoſe did, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.18, 19. who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the chriſtian faith, confeſſed &amp; ſhewed their deeds, and ſome brought their books of curious arts, and <hi>burned them before all men.</hi> There is no other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage concerning <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme which ſeemes to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate privacy, or that it was not done according to the tenor of the former Scriptures; but rather comply therewith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.30. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4.1. <hi>Luk.</hi> 7.29 <hi>Act.</hi> 1.21, 22. <hi>Act.</hi> 10.37. <hi>Peter</hi> in this laſt
<pb facs="tcp:170420:12"/>Scripture ſpeaking of the Goſpel, ſaith it was that word which you know was publiſhed throughout all <hi>Judea,</hi> &amp; began from <hi>Galilee, after the Baptiſme which John preached.</hi> Which phraſe further cleeres it to us, that <hi>John</hi> firſt preached to the people concerning the nature &amp; uſe of his baptiſme, before he baptized them; which hints his baptiſme as publique as his preaching. There is only one inſtance more to be conſidered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſme, &amp; that is his baptizing Chriſt. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Mark</hi> 1.9. In this, 1. there's nothing againſt the publiqueneſs of it, and therefore it may fairly be ſuppoſed to be adminiſtred as publiquely as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inſtances. 2. Yea there's probable proof of the publiqueneſs of it. For 1. Chriſt was pleaſed to come to <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Jordan,</hi> Mat. 3.13. (at which place <hi>John</hi> was preaching to, and baptizing the multitudes ſpoken of in <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. of that ſame chap.) Chriſt did not ſend for <hi>John</hi> to ſome private place (as ſome now would have Miniſters come to their houſes) and <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.21. relates Chriſts &amp; the peoples baptiſm as done together. 2. At this time Chriſt was to be ſolemnly inaugurated unto the manifeſtation of his office (as our Divines ſay) and that declared by a voice from heaven. Now it was of infinite concernment and uſe, that his baptiſme ſhould be publique, and that there ſhould be many witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes thereof; whereby alſo it might publiquely appeare that Chriſt approved of <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, that by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample others might be moved to ſubmit thereunto.</p>

               <p>The examples after Chriſts aſcenſion are divided, ſome adminiſtred in publique, ſome privately, and one doubtfull to which ſort it is to be referred. I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with the publique. We have a notable example of publique baptiſme, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. when the ſame day (that they had heard <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, and probably of other Apoſtles) there were added 3000 ſouls who were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized. <hi>Act</hi> 8.12. <hi>When they</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Samaria</hi>) <hi>beleeved Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdome of God, and the name of Jeſus Chriſt, they were baptized both men and women.</hi> Here baptizing was as publique as preaching. Now the preaching was publique where all had free admiſſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6. At this ſame time one is particularly mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. <hi>Simon,</hi> who beleeved <hi>Philips</hi> preaching and miracles, as the former perſons did, and was baptized at the ſame time, ſo <hi>Act.</hi> 18.8. Another example occurres, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.44, 47, 48. in like manner deſcribed. That's a notable one, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.13, 14. <hi>On the Sabbath</hi> (ſaith the text) we went out of the City by a river ſide, and we ſate down and ſpake to the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which reſorted thither, and <hi>v.</hi> 14, 15. <hi>Lydia</hi> was there converted, and its probable, baptized and her houſhold. For after ſhe &amp; her houſhold was baptized, ſhe invited the Apoſtles home to her private houſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. Now if it had been the uſe to baptize ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in private, its likely ſhe would have invited them to her houſe before, that ſhe and her houſhold might there have been baptized.</p>

                  </gap>me rather to caſt it among the Inſtances of publique baptiſme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opportunities of thoſe times; which appeare by laying theſe circumſtances together. 1. <hi>Paul</hi> was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly converted in his going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> &amp; ſtruck blind neer to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> to which place he was led. 2. In <hi>Damaſcus</hi> there was a brotherhood of Chriſtians, (a Church) at this time, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.19. 3. This miraculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Paul</hi> could not be concealed from theſe bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren there; For there were divers with <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was miraculouſly converted, who heard the voyce from heaven, who were likely to ſpeak of it: the very novelty and wonder of the matter would make them divulge it: beſides alſo they being <hi>Pauls</hi> companions on his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and probably aſſiſting to him in his perſecuting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne, could not be inſenſible of their concernment, in the voyce ſpeaking, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> which would be an obligation on them to give God the glory of the viſion by declaring it. And what ſtory could they make in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to ſatisfie them who ſhould enquire concerning <hi>Pauls</hi> blindneſſe who was led by them; but they muſt tell the truth? the weighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtrong influence of the preſent providence, not permitting a diſſimulation of the matter. And the ſame may be ſaid over againe, much more to ſhew that <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe was not likely to conceale this thing. 4. <hi>Paul</hi> was three dayes blind at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> before <hi>Ananias</hi> came to him. 5. Its very probable <hi>Paul</hi> after his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion being now under the terrour of his former cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty againſt Chriſt in his members, and at preſent blind, would deſire to be conducted to the houſe of ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> or at leaſt ſend for ſome diſciples to him. 6. And as probable it is, that many diſciples would flock in to him, hearing of the mighty work of God done on him. 7. Its alſo noted that he faſted the three
<pb facs="tcp:170420:14"/>dayes and three nights of his blindneſſe; and that (like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) for a religious end, and then he would joyn ſolemn prayer therewith, (to which I ſuppoſe the voyce ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Ananias</hi> eſpecially refers, which ſaith of <hi>Paul, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he prays,</hi> i.e. now he is praying or joyning in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, having ſet himſelfe ſeriouſly to be humbled for his former ſin.) 8. And now its not likely he ſpent 3 dayes in prayer all alone, Its probable therefore there were the Diſciples in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> gathered to him, into the houſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> whither <hi>Ananias</hi> was inſtructed to goe to <hi>Paul,</hi> and where he baptized him. Neither may it be forcibly objected, that becauſe of his former rage againſt Chriſtianity, the diſciples in <hi>Damaſcus</hi> would not ſo ſoon truſt him as to come unto him. Upon which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, ſome time after, the Church at <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> durſt not receive him into their company. For theſe at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus</hi> who heard of his viſion, &amp; might ſee him hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under his blindneſſe, would hereby be made fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe of receiving hurt from him. And yet the Diſciples at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> who wanted thoſe advantages of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, might prudently ſcruple at a ſuddain admiſſion of him into their ſociety. If all theſe taken together wil not amount to a probability, that here were with <hi>Paul</hi> a conſiderable number of Chriſtians, and a free invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them hither (which in thoſe times might be ſuch an aſſembly as uſed there ſolemnly to joyn in publique ordinances) who might be preſent when <hi>Paul</hi> was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by <hi>Ananias,</hi> yet I thinke more will hardly be ſaid for a probability of the contrary; and ſo I leave it.</p>

(4) And laſtly, the Miniſter herein hath opportunity to approve himſelfe publiquely in the adminiſtration hereof, in a right man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and to ſubjects capable of the ſame according to Goſpel Rule. 4. The horrible abuſe formerly and now in ſome places, making many baptiſmes private tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions (with a few women only preſent beſides the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter &amp; Father of the infant baptized;) as alſo the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation that this is generally the imployment of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Miniſters; ſhould make us leſſe free in comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them herein; leaſt we bring contempt on our perſons, function, and Miniſtry. 5.

The exceeeding great ſnares and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences which private baptiſme brings on the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, when he baptizeth ſome privately and not others, may diſſwade us from gratifying any herein, unleſſe we would comply with all who may deſire it; and then I thinke (in ſome places) we ſhould have few baptized in the publique Congregation. What grudges and ſurmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of partiality this may beget, we cannot be ignorant. 7. Either baptiſme is a private or publique ordinance; If private, then it needs not at all to be adminiſtred pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely. If publique, then it ought not to be adminiſtred privately, where it may be publiquely and that fitly. I ſay fitly, for ſometimes even ſolemn preaching may be in private places, but not when it may fitly be in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique:
<pb facs="tcp:170420:15"/>ſo is the caſe here. 8.

               <p>I ſhall only hereunto adde the determinations of the Engliſh Liturgy, and the Directory. Though in ſome caſes of great neceſſity (as the Common prayer book ſpeaks) it permit private baptiſm, yet if the child live, it is to be brought to the Congregation, where the Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors ſhall make ſolemn profeſſions, as in the order for publique baptiſm; and the Congregation being ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, the child is publiquely to be declared ſolemnly received into the Church. Now how ſhamefully do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of our corner Baptizers, who pretend much for the Epiſcopal Government and Common prayer book, offend againſt this Direction?</p>
               <p>The Directory (which I ſuppoſe is owned as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Authority humane, eſpecially in a doubtfull caſe, in this County, moſt of the Miniſters names where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then reſident here when the Presbyterial Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was firſt commended to us by the Parliament, I have by me, ſubſcribed with their own hands, to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their judgement for that way, and reſolution to put the ſame in practice) it orders expreſly thus: <q>
                     <hi>Baptiſm is not to be adminiſtred in private places, nor privately, but in the place of the publique worſhip, and in the face of the Congregation.</hi>
                  </q> There is but one, I know of, profeſſing the Congregational way, who comes to private houſes in the Country, and with the parents and a few women, baptizeth, and this I think is offenſive to the Miniſters of the ſame way he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, as well as to others of us his neighbours. Now we all profeſs to be ſtudious of peace. But how ſhall we make it appear, if in ſuch a thing which all I think ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge lawfull, we comply not with the Directions
<pb facs="tcp:170420:16"/>of the former conſtitutions of the State and Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the preſent Rules commended to us by the Parliament, with the aſſiſtance of ſo Reverend an Aſſembly, as they had herein? which yet reſpect only our uniform practice, and tie us not to an opinion of neceſſity, that Baptiſm ſhould be ever adminiſtred thus publiquely. Should not thoſe Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Phil</hi> 3.15, 16. and ſuch like, have ſome impreſſion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as to this matter? I leave it to the conſideration of the peaceably Judicious. Now I come to my ſecond Concluſion I deduced probably from the peruſal of the forementioned examples of Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> That</p>

               <p>From the ordinary Rule of publique Baptiſm, there is ſome exception in ſome ſpecial caſes. That there is ſuch an exception is already proved, by the Scriptures produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But to ſet down a perfect enumeration of ſuch caſes wherein that exception hath place, I dare not profeſſe ability to undertake; but I ſhall endeavour ſomewhat herein according to my poor meaſure, 1 Negatively. 2. Affirmatively.</p>

               <p>Divers things are pretended as of weight, when they occurre, to challenge an exception from the common Rule of publique Baptiſm, which I humbly conceive are of no validity for the ſame. 1. The childs weakneſſe, and danger of death, is no ſufficient reaſon for private Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, (this is the only exception allowed by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer book.) Indeed this ſeems rather a reaſon for the denying of private Baptiſm, then granting it, leaſt they who demand it ſhould be ſtrengthened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by in the conceit of the neceſſity of Baptiſm for ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the infant, <hi>ratione medii.</hi> They ſhould rather by our preaching and practice be informed in the right doctrine of the Sacraments. It's true ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
<pb facs="tcp:170420:17"/>in the heat of their oppoſition to the Pelagians, who denied original ſin, went ſo far, as to lay ſtreſs of ſalvation upon Baptiſm. But others were more ſound, who teach, that not the defect or want ſimply, but the neglect of them is the crime. Now there is not a neglect, where the firſt opportunity is taken for ſolemn publike Baptiſm, no more then there is a neglect of the Lords Supper, although it be not received by him who cannot come to the Congregation, who yet is ready and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to lay hold on the firſt opportunity he can, to joyn himſelf in the publique Communion of the Church in that Ordinance. 2. Nor is the gratification of mens (or rather womens) humours, a ſufficient reaſon for private Baptiſm. For then it ſhould be denied to none who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it on that account, one mans humour being of as much validity as anothers; and this will not weigh down the Diſſwaſives from a private celebration, before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed. And then again, a ſick mans deſiring the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion ſhould be a ſufficient reaſon for our private adminiſtring of the Lords Supper unto him in a private houſe, where the Church hath not free acceſſe, of which there is no footſteps (that I know of) in the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. 3. Nor is the pretence of a cuſtom to have feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and entertainments (which may not fitly be on the Lords day) a ſufficient reaſon for private baptiſm; for that cuſtom ought rather to be altered, then the ten former inconveniences of private baptiſm ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. And it is altered eaſily in ſome places (by the Miniſters perſwaſion) that they have their feaſtings on a week day (where they are of ability to have them) when the baptiſm is on the Lords day. But it's known experimentally, that many invited to ſuch entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (in Country Villages) do not uſe to come to the Church to be preſent at the baptiſm, as making this the leaſt part of their buſineſſe at ſuch a time. And upon the
<pb facs="tcp:170420:17"/>ſame pretence laſt mentioned, two or three (perhaps more) Lords daies, or other opportunities for publique baptiſm are neglected, till they be prepared for their dinnerings, which I ſuppoſe is a fault in the Parents; agreeable to what the fore-praiſed <hi>Zepperus</hi> in the Chapter mentioned, quotes out of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, <hi>de immolat.

               <p>Private baptiſm then hath place when the caſe is ſuch as the expediences thereof for the general good of the Church do over-weigh the fore-mentioned inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. More particularly, as 1. In the firſt gathering of a Church, ſince they who are to be members thereof, are to be ſolemnly made diſciples by baptiſm, there may be a neceſſity that ſome who are the firſt fruits of the place muſt be baptized privately: for Church order ſuppoſeth a Church exiſting, wherein it ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed and obſerved. But where a Church is conſtituted, there this hath no place. 2. In times of perſecution, when there cannot be ſet ſolemn Aſſemblie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, but Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as they may catch at an opportunity of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; It's a greater inconvenience to the Church that Baptiſm ſhould be omitted, then that it ſhould be cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated privatly. But I did not need to put in this caſe, unleſſe the perſecution be raiſed againſt this Ordinance, rather then preaching, for as I have ſtated the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, baptiſm is not to be called private, which is as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique as the ordinary preaching in the Church is at that
<pb facs="tcp:170420:18"/>time. 3. A like caſe hereunto is that, in times of groſſe defection and Idolatry in the Church, where this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance cannot be publiquely adminiſtred, without ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious or heretical mixtures, as in Popiſh Countryes. 4. There may poſſibly occurre ſome Inſtance, wherein, an eminent reſpect to Gods glory, propagating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and the good of the Catholique Church, may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant private baptiſme; that being to be preferred to the advantages of a particular Congregation in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. This I ſuppoſe was the caſe of the Eunuch, to whom <hi>Philip</hi> was directed by the extraordinary dictate of the Spirit, who being on his journey to his own (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote) Country, was converted, and then inſtantly bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: of whom <hi>Euſebius</hi> in his Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory. <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 1. (according to <hi>Hanmers</hi> tranſlation) ſaith; <q>He was the firſt of the Gentiles, which obtained of <hi>Philip</hi> the holy myſteries, by the inſpiration of the heavenly word; he was made the firſt fruits of the faithfull throughout the world. And as it is reported, after his return unto his native ſoyle, he preached the knowledge of the Univerſal God, which giveth life unto men, and the coming of our Saviour, whereby the prophecy was fulfilled, which ſaid, <hi>Aethiopia ſhall ſtretch her hand before unto God:</hi>
                  </q> ſo he. And ſo this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance falls alſo under the firſt caſe for private baptiſm. That example of the Jaylors baptiſm and his houſhold, comes under the firſt and ſecond caſe; that being a time of perſecution, and <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> then impriſoned, and knew not when they might hope to be releaſed; much leſſe when they ſhould have an opportunity of aſſembling the Church in that neighbourhood. And its not altogether improbable that many other Chriſtian priſoners might be there, and then there might be a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſembly agreeable to the allowance of thoſe troubleſome times. What other caſes there may be of
<pb facs="tcp:170420:18"/>like exigence as to private baptiſme, I refer to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of better judgements.</p>

               <p>None of theſe ſingular caſes wherein baptiſme was privately adminiſtred, do (for any thing I know) occur in the preſent times among us. If there be conceived to be ſome analogical or proportionate to theſe, as to this matter, it concernes them who think ſo, to name them, and to prove the ſame; the three fore pretended ones I have already ſhewed not to be ſuch. And I know none elſe pretended, except, (1) the gratifying Separatiſts, ſome whereof would ſuffer their children to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at home with a ſelect company of their own only preſent, but ſeparate from our publique Aſſemblyes, as no rightly conſtituted Churches: (2) And very rarely (perhaps) one convinced of the errour of Antipedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſme, who hath been tainted therewith before, ſeemes inclinable to have his children baptiſed at home, but is loath to honour God ſo far as publiquely to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the devoting his ſeed to God in this ordinance. But if we comply with the former we wrong our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and ſeem to take upon our ſelves the diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they lay upon us in their unwarrantable ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And the humouring the latter, ſeems to be a wrong to baptiſme it ſelfe: the honour whereof had need to be carefully preſerved in theſe times. And the Queſtion in this caſe ſeems to be, whether the real honor of Gods holy ordinance, or the imaginary ſuppoſed though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) falſe honour and credit of theſe people ſhould be moſt reſpected</p>
               <p>I have now plainly layd down before you my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions in this matter, &amp; ſhall add nothing more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, ſave that upon a review I conceive it may be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to expreſſe my ſelfe more fully, in one thing which hath been hinted already, <hi>viz.</hi> What we ſhall call pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb facs="tcp:170420:19"/>baptiſme? to which I have anſwered, that ſuch a place &amp; convention of Chriſtians as is judged meet for the ordinary exerciſe of miniſterial publique preaching, is a place and ſociety to adminiſter baptiſme in, if we would have it to be publique baptiſme. According to which rule, more particularly I ſay. 1. Baptiſme in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſe is not publique though many be there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe this would not (in times of freedome) be counted a fit place for ordinary conventions of the Church for preaching. 2. Baptiſme on the week day, at the place of publique aſſembly, where there is not ſo conſiderable a number preſent, as it would be counted expedient for a publique Sermon to be made to, is yet but private baptiſme. 3. I ſuppoſe it alſo requiſite that the Congregation on the Lords day before have notice of the time of a baptiſme intended there, the week fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing (unleſs there be ſome known lecture or exerciſe there at that time, or at leaſt we may probably expect a conſiderable number of Chriſtians then) that they may freely repair unto the Word and Sacrament then to be diſpenced; the uſuall ſignes being given for warning a publique tranſaction. 4. Yet if it be judged unfit, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to call an aſſembly of the Church, I ſuppoſe at ſuch time when we cannot urge a conſiderable number of our Congregation to attend in publique, nor blame their abſence, we may not appoint a publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for them to be preſent at. For this ſeemes little better then a prevaricating with them. 5. To conclude, Hence it follows, that its not this or that number pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, which is neceſſary to the making a baptiſmal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration publique in the place of publique Church meetings; For then we ſhould be at a loſſe, what ſhould be the leaſt number neceſſary: But the adminiſtring it at ſuch a time, and in ſuch a place, where and when the Congregation may freely and is obliged to attend. We
<pb facs="tcp:170420:19"/>may (in ſome Pariſhes or Chappelries) ſuſpect ſomtimes on the Lords dayes, and upon other ſpecial and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant occaſions for preaching on other dayes, when we call an aſſembly, that few wil be preſent, yet do we then preach publiquely though to never ſo few, becauſe its not our fault that the Church is ſo empty. But if it were our fault that ſo few are preſent, by taking inconvenient times, either of the dayes of the week, when their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions call them another way; or of the houres of the day, which are not uſuall nor commodious for an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly; or laſtly, if we ſhould call them to attend preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo frequently, that we could not reaſonably expect the attendance of a conſiderable Congregation: I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in theſe caſes we ſhould offend in pretending to the exerciſe of publique preaching before ſo ſmall a number. And the ſame ſhould I ſay concerning publique baptiſme. For this is my maine direction, that theſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of publique preaching and adminiſtring Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme ought to go parallel one with another, in regard of the publiqueneſſe of diſpencing the ſame. ¶.</p>

            <p>It is ſaid by ſome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(1)"/> that no unregenerate or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant and ſcandalous members in the Church, being baptized and of years, not excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, may be debarred the Lords Supper, they expreſſing their deſires to receive, and proferring themſelves.

            <p>For the better underſtanding of this poſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(2)"/> according to the mind of the Aſſertors thereof, it may be noted, That</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Thoſe who defend the forementioned <hi>Theſis,</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(4)"/> hold it unlawfull to advice the forementioned perſons, to forbear, as well as to hinder them by juridicall ſuſpenſion. I hold the lawfulneſs of debarring both waies; and the proving of either overthrows the foreſaid poſition, according to the minde of them who aſſert the ſame.</p>

            <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(17)"/> It is not neceſſary in oppoſition to my Antagoniſts Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I ſhould ſay all unregenerate, ignorant or ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous members baptized, &amp;c. may be debarred or ſuſpended the Lords Supper. But it is ſufficient to overthrow their opinion if I prove that ſome may, For their tenent in reference to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons of years not excommunicate, is an <hi>univerſall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative,</hi> that none ſuch may be debarr'd.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(18)"/> It belongs not to the preſent diſquiſition, for what or how many ſins, or in how many and what caſes, any perſon qualified as aforeſaid may be debarred; but whether in any caſe for any ſin, he may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred. For if in any caſe it may be lawfull to ſuſpend a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon not fully excommunicate (and that is, according to the ſenſe of my Antagoniſts here excluded from all publique ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Church) then that cannot be freed from untruth, which they aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is no ſuch ordinance of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion in the Church approved by Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(19)"/> This caution is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170420:23"/>not more plaine in it ſelfe (and what can be plainer?) then it is uſefull and neceſſary to be remembred in this diſpute. I ſhall therefore further illuſtrate it, by a familiar ſimilitude. If one ſhould ſay that no flagitious <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who is not cut off from the freedom of the Corporation where he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, may legally be whipt; I need not to contradict him, prove, that all flagitious <hi>Engliſh</hi> perſons not deprived of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome aforeſaid, may be whipt; but to prove that ſome may, in ſome caſes, is a ſufficient contradiction to him who ſaith none may in any caſe: ſo is the preſent caſe in reference to Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall polity.</p>
            <p>In oppoſition therefore to the foreſaid poſition, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(20)"/> I aſſert, <q>That it is lawfull for ſome perſons in ſome caſes to debar by diſſwaſion, ſuſpending their own act of adminiſtring, or by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Cenſure (I ſay to debar) ſome perſons from the Lords Supper, who are baptized, and not warn'd to depart (or kept) from other publique Ordinances, of hearing, praying, ſinging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the publique Congregations of the Church.</q>

               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(21)"/> Thoſe who are viſibly ſuch whom the Lord hath in his Word declared to be perſons to whom he would not have the Lords Supper adminiſtred, may be ſulpended from the Lords Supper. But ſome baptized perſons not fully excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, may be viſibly ſuch whom the Lord hath in his word declared to be perſons to whom he would not have the Lords Supper adminiſtred. <hi>Ergo</hi> ſome baptized perſons at years not fully excommunicate, may be ſuſpended from the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> is cleere, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(22)"/> if it be underſtood, that by <hi>viſibly,</hi> I meane ſuch as are proved and appeare ſo to be by Scripture Characters. And now the <hi>major</hi> is not likely to be deny'd: Becauſe God hath placed a power ſomewhere in his Church, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(23)"/> for the managing of his Ordinances, ſo as that they may not be diſpenſed to ſuch as he hath declared in his word, he would not have them adminiſtred unto.</p>
            <p>The <hi>minor</hi> is thus proved.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(24)"/> are viſibly ſuch to whom the Lord would not (according to the revelation of his will in his word) have the Lords Supper adminiſtred. But ſome baptized perſons at years not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excommunicate, may be ſuch as openly by word renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Ergo</hi> ſome baptized perſons at years
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170420:23"/>not fully excommunicat, may be viſibly ſuch to whom the Lord would not have the Sacrament adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>major</hi> here againe I thinke will not be deny'd. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(25)"/> But leaſt it ſhould, I thus prove it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are viſibly unbelievers (I meane who ought to be judged and taken to be unbelievers) are viſibly ſuch to whom (according to the word) the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred. But thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ought to be judged and taken to be unbelievers. <hi>Ergo</hi> thoſe who by word open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt are viſibly ſuch, to whom (according to the word of God) the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe is cleare. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(26)"/> For if the word warrant us to adminiſter the Sacrament only to believers (which none can deny) that is, ſuch as are to be taken for believers, then it excludes all them who are to be judged and taken to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. The latter is no leſſe manifeſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(27)"/> For to profeſſe to renounce Chriſt, is to profeſſe not to believe; and he that ſeemes ſeriouſly (for ſo I intend it) to profeſs his not belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, that is, his renouncing Chriſtianity, cannot be by any warrantably judged or taken to be a believer.</p>
            <p>If to the <hi>minor</hi> of my ſecond <hi>Syllogiſme</hi> (which was this; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(28)"/> Some baptized perſons at years not fully excommunicate, may be ſuch as openly by word renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt) it be anſwered,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Excep.</hi> 1. That no baptized perſon at years not fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, tendring himſelfe to receive, will or doth ever ſo openly by word renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. I anſwer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The caſe may yet be ſuppoſed, yea it may happen; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(29)"/> and if in any caſe ſuppoſable which may fall out, ſuſpenſion as diſtinct from that full excommunication before mentioned, may have place according to the Rule of the Word, (which ſhuts out profeſſed open unbelievers from the Sacraments,) then ſuſpenſion cannot be denied univerſally, to have any place diſtinct from that full excommunication. That is really a power for Cenſure, which may be exerted upon an occaſion which may poſſibly occurre, (whether that occaſion do ever occurre, or not, actually.) So a fuperiour may have power to correct his inferiour in ſuch a manner, for ſuch a fault, if he do commit it, though perhaps he never do commit it. 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(30)"/> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the caſe is ſuppoſable, not only as poſſible, but probable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170420:24"/>to occurre, if that which my Antagoniſts in this Queſtion ſo much commend, and which they ſay was happily exerciſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Epiſcopal Government in <hi>England,</hi> ſhould be revived and brought againe into practice among us, <hi>viz.</hi> That all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons of years ſhould be required under a (purſe) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty to communicate once or twice in the year; then many open rejecters of Chriſtianity, and who profeſſe againſt the ſame, (and averre there is no Chriſt without them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) might, to eſcape the penalty, tender themſelves to communicate. I have been credibly informed concerning the Atheiſme of an eminent perſon, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(31)"/> who not many yeares agoe dyed in <hi>London,</hi> who on his death-bed told his friend, who urged him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive before his death, <hi>That to gratifie him he was willing to communicate; but yet with all profeſſed he looked for no good from ſuch things.</hi> Whereupon the Biſhop who was there to have given h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>m the Sacrament turned away from him. But what ſpeak I of one? Theſe times declare that there are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, I feare thouſands, who are above all Ordinances, and count the Sacraments carnall things, and ſay ſo; who yet, its probable, to eſcape a penalty would come to ask the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Excep.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(32)"/> If againe it be ſaid, that perſons baptized and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring themſelves to receive, cannot openly at that time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their rejecting Chriſt: becauſe that in this tender of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Ordinance they offer to profeſs the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> their owning of Chriſt.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(33)"/> I ſay, firſt, the caſe under our preſent conſideration ſuppoſeth him, at the ſame time, when he tenders himſelfe to be admitted to the Communion, to profeſſe (being asked) againſt his owning Chriſt (at leaſt in this Ordinance) <hi>q. d.

Its not impoſſible for ſuch a man to profeſs contradictions; ſo that you cannot conclude he profeſſeth not againſt Chriſt, becauſe he profeſſeth for Chriſt, at the ſame time or with one breath. 3. He that openly denyes Chriſt expreſsly: he profeſſeth to receive Chriſt only by conſequence, from the nature of the Ordinance which he deſires to joyn in; although perhaps he underſtand it not, or doth plainly reject his owning of that Conſequence.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>Excep.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(35)"/> But ſome will ſay; Such an one at that time ſhould
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170420:24"/>be fully excommunicated, and may be, as well as ſuſpended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Whereunto I returne. But there may not (ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily cannot) be power in that particular Congregation, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(36)"/> or the Officers thereof, fully to excommunicate him. How ſhould he be excommunicated at that time, when a meeting of other Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers (a Claſſis) cannot then be had, by whoſe adviſe and authority full excommunication ſhould be managed? And o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther barres beſides may ſufficiently diſſwade from an inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous full excommunication, as ſoon as a perſon diſcovers his rejecting of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Excep.</hi> Furthermore, If it be pleaded, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(37)"/> That we have no ſuch inſtance in our times, and therefore its to little purpoſe to perplex our thoughts with forecaſting what might be done in ſuch an extraordinary caſe. But the preſent Controverſie is concerning ſuch as in word do profeſſe to own Chriſt, when they tender themſelves to communicate, although there be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible teſtimony, that their lives are not agreeable (hitherto) to this profeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I anſwer, Its no needleſſe point of wiſdome, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(38)"/> to labour to foreſee the neceſſary ill Conſequents, which may enſue up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receiving of a principle, although at preſent there is no opportunity for the actuall exiſtency of them. If a wiſe man foreſee that his principle, if followed cloſe, will in ſome caſes which may occurre run him on the rocks, he may juſtly ſuſpect his principle not to be ſo good as it ſhould be. If ſuſpenſion in the caſe propoſed cannot be deny'd, then it muſt not be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally rejected as having no place in the Church. 2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(39)"/> But I ſhall further adde, though not for confirmation of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I have already propoſed to prove and evince this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, viz. <hi>That ſome baptized perſons at yeares not fully excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate may be ſuſpended,</hi> for that needs not this addition. But for the improving the argument to further uſefulneſſe, I ſhall (I ſay) further adde, That this caſe already propoſed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(40)"/> though it ſeeme ſo rare and extraordinary, yet by neceſſary conſequence, it concludes other inſtances of daily and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry incurſion. For if he, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(41)"/> who in words rejects Chriſt may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred, then he who by ſome notorious deeds rejects Chriſt, (though not in words) may be debarred, although he be a perſon baptized, at yeares, not fully excommunicate.</p>
            <p>The conſequence I prove thus; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(42)"/> If this conſequence do not hold, it muſt be, either becauſe no deed-rejection of Chriſt is ſo manifeſt, viſible, notorious and hainous a rejecting of Chriſt,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170420:25"/>as word rejecting of Chriſt is; or els becauſe the Officers in the Church have ſome good Rule, according to which they may diſpenſe with (or not deny the Sacrament for) deed-rejecting of Chriſt, rather then word rejecting of Chriſt. But neither of theſe do enervate the conſequence, nor any other Reaſon. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> its good and valid.</p>
            <p>Not the latter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(43)"/> becauſe no ſuch Rule can be produced, but rather the contrary; <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(44)"/> Not the former, Becauſe words are no otherwiſe Teſtimonies then as they are ſignes of a perſons rejecting or owning what in and by theſe words he profeſſeth to own or reject. And ſome deeds are more ſatisfactory Teſtimonies then words. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(45)"/> 
               <hi>Validior eſt vox operis quam oris.</hi> Where there be two croſs-witneſſes, the Teſtimony of the more credible witneſſe juſtly prevailes againſt the other. So when deeds croſs words in the preſent caſe, the Deeds may be more credible Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and ſignes of a perſons rejecting Chriſt, then his words are of the contrary. And therefore this deed-witneſſe is to prevaile againſt the word witneſſe. I have heard from a great Lawyer, that in our common Laws, they have this Rule, that <hi>Actions ſpeak either aſſent or diſſent.</hi> And ſhall not the Church make uſe of the ſame meanes naturally ſubſervient to the diſcerning of perſons, who are to be admitted to, or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from the Sacraments?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(46)"/> If the deed-rejecting of Chriſt were not of as certaine credible ſignification concerning a perſons infidelity, as word rejecting is, Then no perſon who denies not Chriſt in words may be fully excommunicated; eſpecially if he deſire to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mmunicate, and that earneſtly, which theſe men ſay is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of his ſeriouſneſſe, which we may not refuſe in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to believe. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(47)"/> And doubtleſſe the Church ought not by full excommunication to declare a perſon to be as an Infidel, and ſo to be dealt with, who now makes a credibly ſerious profeſſion of his faith, and willingneſs to ſubmit himſelfe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(48)"/> But if they do fully excommunicate him, they do declare him in a ſtate, wherein he is to be looked on, and to be dealt with, as with an Heathen, or, by word-profeſſed, Infidel.</p>
            <p>By all this which hath been ſaid as an Appendix to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(49)"/> (and much more might be added to the ſame purpoſe) It may appear, that, If it be granted that one though formerly baptized, and not yet fully excommunicated, yet now being
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170420:25"/>an openly, and by word profeſſed, Infidel, may be ſuſpended in any caſe when there is a barre againſt his then full excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: then at leaſt in the like caſe, ſome ſcandalous livers in the Church may be ſuſpended. And therefore becauſe ſo much depends upon the former, I have ſo largely inſiſted on the proving and cleering of the ſame. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="(50)"/> I remember I have read ſomewhere in <hi>Salvian. Qui Christiani Nominis opus non agit, Christianus non eſſe videatur.</hi> And <hi>Infidelis ſit neceſſe eſt, qui fidei commiſſa non ſervat.</hi> Agreeable whereunto is what I finde quoted from <hi>Tertull. apolog. cap.</hi> 44. who ſpeaking of the Heathens priſons ſaith, <hi>Nemo illic Chriſtianus niſi planè tantum Chriſtianus; aut ſi &amp; aliud, jam non Chriſtianus.</hi>

            <p>¶ There was another argument in my paper for the taking off the imputation of novelty which is charged on ſuſpenſion. But not above a fourth part of it is printed by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> &amp; the reſt, not anſwered by him. So I ſhall not here tranſcribe it. Perhaps divers things therein will occaſionally fall in to be mentioned elſewhere. And I have no ſuch conceipt of my writings as to trouble the Reader with any more of them then I am in a manner forced unto. I ſhall now apply my ſelfe to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his pretended refutation of the argument mentioned; and I ſhall intend to omit nothing material he hath produced, yea I ſhall take in much more then I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend pertinent alledged by him. But the moſt of the Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions as about examination, Elders, and the like, I ſhall deſigne to ſpeak to by themſelves, that the diſcuſſion of the argument, be not made too confuſed by the intermixture of thoſe hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneals therein. And there are few things but are mentioned by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> many times over, and therefore though I ſometimes lightly paſs over ſome things he hath in his firſt or ſecond, perhaps third or fourth ſpeaking of them, I muſt entreat the Readers patience, and hope before I make an end, he ſhall finde I have not neglected any thing conſiderable of his alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations. And where I apprehended moſt need, I have enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and confirmed my argument in the moſt important parts of it. So that the judicious I hope ſhall diſcerne ſundry argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wrapped up in the proſecution of this one. I have alſo noted the particulars of the argument as managed in my paper he anſwers to, with (1) (2) (3) (4) to 50 &amp;c. in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, to ſave the labour of tranſcribing them againe in the following diſcourſe, and that it may not grow too big; I ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170420:26"/>eaſily by helpe of theſe numbers referre the Reader to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars there, which he may turne back to as there may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion all along, at leaſt very frequently. And the diſcourſe following falling into 22 Chapters, I ſhall for the compoſing my own ſpirit the better, annex at the end of each Chapter one part of the 119 <hi>Pſalme</hi> done into <hi>Engliſh</hi> according to the Acroſtical conceit of the Originall, which I truſt will not be altogether ungratefull to the Reader, having been never that I know of done before. And let theſe be our <hi>crums of comfort,</hi> in ſtead of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his <hi>crums of merriment</hi> which he intimates as needfull for our <hi>refreſhing in ſo unpleaſing an argument.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. There is nothing more uſuall in polemick Authors, then in their anſwering the pretenſions of their Antagoniſts upon any point, to ſtate the Queſtion and ſet down what is granted and denyed, and often to tax their Adverſaries with a wrong ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the point to be diſcuſſed. There's none who have read <hi>Chamier</hi> againſt the Papiſts, nor <hi>Chemnitius</hi> againſt the <hi>Council of Trent,</hi> or any ſuch like Authors, but muſt obſerve how ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary this is with them; and yet the Papiſts were never (that I know of) ſo ſilly as to charge them with an unaccademical procedure in their diſputations with, and refutations of them.</p>

And I matter not though it be not concealed, that as I diſliked not all in the writings of thoſe who were againſt ſuſpenſion, ſo I could not comply with all I found in the writings of them who were for the ſuſpenſion pleaded for. Was it not neceſſary then that I ſhould freely impart my opinion concerning the point which I was deſired to give ſome account of? which indeed is ſuch as partakes of both parties, and is not wholly included in the propoſals of either of them. And M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>W.</hi> might eaſily ſee by my ſtating the Queſtion, that though I held a concluſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the maine aſſertion of thoſe Gentlemen who have written againſt ſuſpenſion; yet I have by the putting in of the term <hi>fully</hi> or <hi>not fully excommunicate,</hi> altered ſomewhat of the manner or method neceſſary for the defending or overthrowing the ſame.</p>

Its the known way of the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> and ſuch like people, in their writings or Diſputes to jumble many things together, and they will not be gotten to ſpeake cloſely to one thing by it ſelfe. Let the Reader judge whether Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his diſcourſe do not by his example too much patronize that their roving and looſeneſs? The order of the whole Controverſie I take it lyes thus. 1. Whether any perſons baptized at yeares intelligent not fully excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (or if you will, <hi>not ſecluded from other Ordinances</hi>) may be debarred the Sacrament? 2. Whether they may be debarred by diſſwaſion only? 3. Whether by a juridical act? 4. In what caſes or for what crimes they may be debarred? 5. By whom that juridical act may be exerted for the debarring of them? In the firſt of theſe would be conſidered; whether a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential debarring one the Sacrament, be not really an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication? 2. Whether there is not a further degree of excommunication then this? 3. Whether its not lawfull to exert the firſt when the latter is not? And in the fourth, It might be enquired further: How farre ignorance may be a cauſe of ſuſpenſion? 2.

And yet Mr. <hi>W.</hi> calls theſe my <hi>Limitations</hi> and explanations of the Queſtion, <hi>Extravagancies,</hi> and <hi>need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe Inventions;</hi> when as their deſigne was to keep from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies; and if he who took upon him to anſwer that paper, had duely obſerved them (as was meet) his diſcourſe would have been much better, although much ſhorter, then it is.</p>

                  <p>My firſt limitation (which may be ſeene at numb. (3) and (4) in the copy of my firſt paper,) Mr. <hi>W.</hi> (I thinke) pretends

To this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers, <hi>p.</hi> 14. <hi>They</hi> (he meanes my Antagoniſts) <hi>hold there is no ſuch kinde of ſuſpending power as you ſtand for, preſcribed in the word of God, for refuſing to ſubmit to your examination.—It is your uſurped kind of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion they except againſt, as you your ſelfe might have ſcene, had you read their workes through, as you ſnatch at a piece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. See now how nimble our learned Gentleman is, to evade the queſtion if he could. Is our queſtion, <hi>Whether perſons may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170420:29"/>be ſuſpended for reſuſing to ſubmit to examination;</hi> not that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to ſpeake to that in its due place; but firſt we enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in any caſe, for any crime, the perſons before mentioned may be debarred? and that was Mr. <hi>Timſons</hi> poſition before rehearſed, viz. <hi>No unregenerate, or ignorant and ſcandalous members in the Church; being baptized, and of years not excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, may be debarred the Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c. It was not, none may be debarred for ignorance, or refuſing to ſubmit to examination. But none though never ſo ſcandalous members in the Church may be debarred. And this I oppoſed; which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhould have defended, as he took upon him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Is not this a pretty ſtating the queſtion Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and informes me in? viz. <hi>Whether is an uſurped kinde of ſuſpenſion lawfull?</hi> This is even like to the queſtion, <hi>Quot ſunt quinque praedicabilia?</hi> But what are we the better for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing in that queſtion, when as it preſently occurres; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there is any ſuſpenſion not uſurped?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But indeed I ſee no Antagoniſt who is ſo ſilly as to ſtate the queſtion on that faſhion; though Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſay if I had read their works through, I might have ſeene, it is our uſurped kind of ſuſpenſion, that they except againſt. Alas! good man! how induſtrious is he to make the world believe I am a man of no reading? I will not goe about to perſwade them of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Yet I muſt needs ſay I had read through divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors againſt ſuſpenſion, and particularly Mr. <hi>Timpſons</hi> bookes, before I drew up thoſe lines which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath aſſaulted. I would not have told this, but that I apprehend it will be no matter of glory and commendation to me; and it affords an argument ſomewhat probable in mine opinion to evince that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is not infallible, who inſinuates (elſwhere as well as in this place) my not reading <hi>Timſons</hi> works through, but ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a piece.

                  <p>IN my fourth note (at number 7, 8, 9.) I ſaid that my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts by [excommunicate], underſtand them who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar'd from all publick Ordinances in the Church, as hearing, praying, &amp;c. And therefore if: I prove the perſon ſpoken of in the queſtion, not debar'd from theſe, may yet be debar'd the Sacrament, it cannot be denied I ſhal rightly conclude againſt their aſſertion; wherein I do not declare any thing of my own judgment concerning Excommunication, but ſpeak onely <hi>ad hominem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And here though Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath not a word againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this Note, he carries it as if he would ſeem to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute it, by 1. rendring <hi>extra communionem ejectio,</hi> an ejection out of the common union (as if there were not degrees of communion, and ſo not of an ejection out of communion). 2. by rambling about the <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> without any occaſion at all miniſtred by any thing I had ſpoken here in this note. for his mentioning the ſame. 3. By concluding thus: <hi>But for your full overthrowing of our aſſertion, we ſhall believe it when we ſee it. We believe you cannot, I am ſure you do not:</hi> What needed this vapour here? The man is prodigall of them being ſufficientiy ſtockt for the largeſt expence of them. I boaſted not of a full overthrow of their aſſertion, but ſaid, That if I prove a perſon baptized, adult, intelligent, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the publick Ordinances of hearing, praying, &amp;c. in the Church, I ſhall then fully overthrow their aſſertion which holds none baptized, adult, intelligent, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170420:30"/>may be debarred. The which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doth not deny, yea he grants it in ſeveral paſſages of his Book, expreſſy or by conſequence. But the former particular about <hi>Divine right,</hi> he is often upon: and he ſo often (as diſturb'd if not intoxicated with paſſion) reels into diſcourſes concerning prudentials, and <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> charging me for excluding all prudentials from Church-government, that his importunity wil force me to trouble the Reader with ſome ſhort account of my apprehenſions concerning theſe things, he ſo pitifully raves upon throughout his Book.</p>

                  <head>§ 2.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. The Lawes of Chriſtianity are given to men ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed not altogether deſtitute of right Reaſon, ſome beams of the Image of God, ſome remains of that ſignature imprinted on man at his firſt creation, ſtill continuing upon him. And men are not called to lay aſide any of their natural right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in their becoming Chriſtians; but rather by Chriſtian helps to attain to an higher improvement, to a more noble elevation and uſe thereof. And therefore whatſoever right Reaſon doth dictate in reſpect of government in generall, agreeing to all government as ſuch, (as it doth in many things) Chriſtians are to make uſe thereof in reference to Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal government. Alwayes provided, that that muſt not be accounted right Reaſon, which thwarts the bleſſed Scriptures, which ſhould ever prevail againſt any conceit of our own. Right Reaſon it ſelf teaching us, that God is infinitely wiſer then we, and that Chriſts lawes muſt be obeyed, not diſputed, when once they appear to be his lawes. But the light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (the ſpirit of man, that candle of the Lord,) doth direct in many wholſome things, for the due ordering of any ſociety in a ſuitableneſs to the end for which the aſſociation thereof is lawfully made; whether <hi>Civill,</hi> in Families, Towns, King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, States; or <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> in particular Churches, or in the aſſociations of particular Churches, greater or leſſer</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, the law of Nature, or Naturall Reaſon, is part of Chriſts law, whereby he rules his Church. And therefore Chriſtians not onely may, but ought to act prudentially in the adminiſtration of Church affairs, as well as in other things, and to make uſe of all the light of Reaſon in purſuing that general Rule, <hi>Let all things be done decently, and in order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yet in Eccleſiaſticall government Chriſt the King of his Church hath given us many poſitive Directions in his Word,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170420:30"/>partly by expreſs preceptive Rules, and partly by obligatory preſidents and examples, ſuch eſpecially as were not ſuited to any temporary account of thoſe times, and the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but whoſe ground and reaſon ſtill continues in all the ſucceeding ages and conditions of the Church. Theſe are Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall conſtitutions on a <hi>Divine right ſimply and ſtrictly.</hi> From theſe we may not digreſs upon any pretence of Reaſon whatſoever. Yea becauſe we muſt act rationally, therefore we muſt cloſe with all theſe the directions of wiſdome it ſelf; and deal with all our conceits and humours making inſurrections againſt the ſame, as with mutiners which are in rebellion againſt their Lord and Maſter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In a larger ſenſe alſo a government may be ſaid to be by <hi>Divine right,</hi> not onely in reference to its compliance with the foreſaid poſitive Scripture rules and binding exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, but alſo in reſpect of its rationall ſuitableneſs to godly prudence, for the order and edification of the Church, in things not particularly determined in the Scriptures, and yet neither expreſly nor by conſequence thwarted by the ſame. And thus (I ſuppoſe) who ever have owned a Church-government, they have thought it by Divine right, that is, that it was according to the Scriptures, and not contrary thereunto.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And thus I was ſatisfied to comply with the conſtitutions of the Presbyterial government (the government in ſubſtance upon the matter of all the forraign Proteſtant Churches in Europe) compoſed by a learned, pious, and judicious Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, impoſed by authority of both Houſes of <hi>Parliament,</hi> when I firſt ſetled in this County, and by their Ordinance of <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. 1648. ſtill continued as much in force (for ought I know) as any other law, at leaſt as any other Ordinance of Parliament, divers whereof are acknowledged to be ſtill in force. Upon the apprehenſion, I ſay, of the lawfulneſſe of the ſaid government, partly upon a ſtrictly Scripturall account in the main things, and partly, <hi>viz.</hi> in leſſer matters, upon a rational, prudentiall account not contrary to the Scripture, I did and do ſubmit unto the ſame. And I doubt not if it had been faithfully purſued according to the religious deſign and intention of the impoſers thereof, the excellent fruits thereof through Gods bleſſing. would have been ſo great, as might have ſilenced the moſt of its conſiderable adverſaries</p>

                  <p>In my fifth note. (at <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.11, 12, 13, 14.) I hinted
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170420:31"/>the ordinary and common diſtinction among reformed Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, of the greater and leſſer Excommunication. Here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> crowes over me, as flying to the authority of men of ſo late a ſtanding, for proving the abſtention pleaded for. Whereas any one (yea one whoſe <hi>brains</hi> are as ill <hi>mar'd</hi> as he tells the world <hi>he fears mine are</hi>) may eaſily perceive that I quoted them not to prove ſuſpenſion, but to ſhew that they called Suſpenſion <hi>Leſſer Excommunication.</hi> And therefore thoſe who oppoſe the debarring of the ſuſpended, ſhould not have ſtated this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, ſimply concerning the unexcommunicate without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction. And yet for all Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſo much blames me for this, he himſelf quotes <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> who (ſaith he <hi>pag.</hi> 18.) being <hi>as great an Antiquary, and as great a reverencer of true Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as any of you, ſaith, That though degrees of excommunication may eaſily be proved from the writings of the Fathers, yet no ſuch thing can be proved from Scripture.</hi> And Mr. <hi>W.</hi> gives his own judgment thus, pag. 20. 21. <hi>We deny not degrees unto excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, nor in excommmnication unto further degrees of ſeverity in caſe of perſiſtance in obſtinacy againſt the authority of the Church.</hi> To both which I anſwer, 1. Compariſons are odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Doth Mr. <hi>W.</hi> know, that none who aſſert ſuſpenſion, do excell <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> in knowledge and eſteem of Antiquity?

                  <p>THe terms of <hi>Excommunication full,</hi> or <hi>not full,</hi> ſundry times do occurre in the following Argument. Theſe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170420:33"/>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> rejects as <hi>adokima's,</hi> as <hi>fooleries,</hi> as <hi>not conſiderable, &amp;c.</hi> and in a fume <hi>piping</hi> hot, he fancies the <hi>bag-pipes</hi> when he hears them named (<hi>p.</hi> 151) Such arguments as theſe muſt be his <hi>apodicticall proofs</hi> againſt them, in refuting whereof belike his friends think I ſhal be hard put to; and they conjecture not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, I ſhal hardly deviſe a reply weak enough to bear a fit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch ſorry pretenſions. But in ſtead thereof I ſhal judge it requiſite to offer ſomewhat concerning excommunication, and that diſtinction of it, ſubmitting the ſame in all humility, to the ſober and judicious; as followeth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The conſideration and ſtrict peruſall of the places and phraſes of Scripture treating on this matter, is the beſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of a right knowledge and diſcerning hereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yet ſome places ſpeak of an excommunication which is not pertinent to our times, or at leaſt not to our preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. I mean that excommunication by way of <hi>Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing</hi> and curſing an incurable offender; to which kind <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus</hi> (<hi>Syntag. l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 18.) referres, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. which he calls the <hi>ſimplex anathema,</hi> and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. called <hi>Anathema maranatha.</hi> And that <hi>cutting off</hi> mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.12. (not to ſpeak of <hi>Hierome</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> their interpretation of it, for the ſmoothing or diſmembring the parts of thoſe Hereticks who ſo much preſſed circumciſion) It is by the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> made parallel to that of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>viz.</hi> (as he ſaith on the place) <hi>as an expreſſion of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the higheſt degree, anſwerable to the</hi> SHAMATHA <hi>among the Jewes;</hi> which he explained on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>to be excommunicated from the hope of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>as leaving the offender to Divine vengeance</hi> (agreeable to the denunciation of <hi>Enoch,</hi> Jude v. 14.) which is denounced againſt them who <hi>love not Chriſt,</hi> that is, as he excellently expounds it, who fall from Chriſt, by renouncing of him to avoid perſecution, eſpecially if teachers of others, ſo to do, and juſtifying the thing as lawfull, as it is ſaid the <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> did. See Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> in Apoc. 21.8. denying the Lord (before men) who bought them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That phraſe alſo of <hi>[delivering to Satan]</hi> though a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſenſe of it, may be, and is accommodated to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary excommunication ſtill in uſe in the Church; yet many, if not moſt, learned Interpreters think, it had a further and more peculiar ſenſe in thoſe Apoſtolicall times, which the Church doth not now look at nor expect, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170420:33"/>externall buffeting the offender by Satan.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There are two other paſſages, which though they are by divers referred to ſome excommunication, yet I think we can build little or nothing upon them, in the explication of this point The firſt is, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to be caſt out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue,</hi> uſed <hi>John</hi> 9.22. and 14.42. and 16.2. Now this is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed only to the Jewes their wicked practice againſt them who owned Chriſt; and the phraſe is no where (that I know of) juſtified by Chriſt or his Apoſtles. And me thinks we have little reaſon to ſeek for the nature of Chriſts Otdinance in the vile practice of his enemies taken by it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The other paſſage is in 3 <hi>John</hi> 10. where <hi>Diotrephes</hi> is ſaid <hi>to caſt</hi> the Chriſtian Jewes <hi>out of the Church,</hi> that is, a Church of the Gentile-Chriſtians. Let us a little peruſe the Text, which runs thus, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I would ask, Who are theſe he <hi>caſt out of the Church?</hi> Not thoſe who <hi>would</hi> entertain the Jewiſh Chriſtian ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, there is no probability any would be ſo ſottiſh, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate them for their <hi>will, deſire,</hi> or <hi>intention</hi> to have entertained thoſe gueſts: and if thoſe he is ſaid to have caſt out, were the gueſts themſelves called the brethren, then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication cannot be here meant, becauſe they were not under the juriſdiction of that Gentile-Church, nor any Officer therof, and ſo could not be caſt out of that particular Church in which they were not before. 2. It cannot be proved that <hi>Diotrephes</hi> was any Church-officer in that Church. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, may ſignifie one who ſeeks inordinatly, or aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth dignity, as well as one that uſeth immoderatly the ſame, and it is very probable (ſaith Doctor <hi>Hammond,</hi> that this <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trephes did this without having any reall authority in the Church, as a preſumptuous, confident bold perſon,</hi> and then his act in caſting any out of the Church, would not be accounted a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential excommunication. 3. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed in the New Teſtament to ſignifie <hi>any hindring,</hi> although it be not by any act authoritative forbidding, nor pretend thereunto, and is rendred <hi>to hinder, Luke</hi> 11.52. and to <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,</hi> Acts. 11.17. and <hi>to let. Rom.</hi> 1.13. and therefore that paſſage wherein this <hi>Diotrephes</hi> is ſaid to <hi>forbid,</hi> or <hi>hinder,</hi> and <hi>withstand</hi> them, who would be more hoſpitable then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, doth not invite us at all to interpret the following words of any authoritative Eccleſiaſticall cenſure. Upon the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170420:34"/>whole matter I humbly conceive, that this paſſage here, <hi>[He caſts them out of the Church]</hi> doth denote nothing elſe, but his thruſting out the Jewiſh gueſts from being kindly har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured, telieved and accommodated in that Church, he by his factious and pragmatical endeavours (taking upon him to be thought ſome body more then ordinary,) laboured to draw the Church to joyn with him in that inhoſpitality, wherein he had among many too good ſucceſſe. But I ſhall not contend in this, onely I have ſignified the probabilities which incline me to conceive that Eccleſiaſticall excommunication is not ſtrictly ſignified by the phraſe of <hi>[caſting out of the Church]</hi> here uſed; at leaſt that it is ſo dubious, that it will be no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtone in the Doctrine of Excommunication.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to conſider the leſs queſtionable and more plain phraſes and paſſages in the New Teſtament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by excommunication is intimated, which are ſuch as theſe.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>To bind on earth,</hi> v. 18. doth alſo relate to the ſame thing. That fifth chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, hath moſt in it concerning <hi>Excommunication,</hi> of any one chapter in the Bible. Here are ſeverall phraſes ſignifying the ſame thing. v. 2. That he who hath done this deed, might be <hi>taken away from you.</hi> So alſo v. 13. <hi>Put away from among your ſelves</hi> that wicked perſon. The phraſe of <hi>delivering to Satan,</hi> uſed verſ. 5. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. ſo far as it may ſignifie what is yet of continued uſe in the Church, is commonly interpreted by the words of Chriſt before mentioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. Let him be to thee as <hi>an Heathen and Publican.</hi> Satan being viſibly the God of the Infidell world, and of the manifeſtly and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly prophane and wicked men, as the Publicans though Jewes, were accounted by their own Nation. But there are in this chapter two more expreſſions concerning excomunication, which we muſt ſomwhat more inſiſt upon, eſpecially the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which wil help to clear the later. The one of theſe in v. 9. and 11. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The other intimation of excommunication, we have in the later end of the eleventh verſe of this. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>not to eat,</hi> which as all agree, includes excluſion from the Lrods Supper; ſo it's very probable it muſt be extended ſo far further, as to leave the wicked brother cenſured under as great a ſeparation from the privat familiarity of the church, as the heathen was. ſee the phraſe elſwhere uſed, <hi>Luk</hi> 15.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 11.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. I ſuppoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170420:35"/>there is little difference betwixt the import of this and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther laſt mentioned. But here that is expreſſed proverbially, or <hi>Symbolically,</hi> which there is more <hi>plainly.</hi> A perſons eating with another, when he doth it upon choyce and deſign, being a ſymbol of intimate friendſhip, and voluntary complacential communion with him. At leaſt ſo it ſeems to have been in thoſe times of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.18, 19. The whole ſignificancy of the phraſe as to the preſent point, is grounded on the opinion and cuſtome of the time and place, where eating with any as aforeſaid, is notoriouſly reputed to be an owning of the courſes of them with whom we eat or drink, and a teſtification of that complacentiall reſpect to them which may probably harden them in their wickedneſſe, and incourage others in the ſame: there <hi>not to eat</hi> is a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary withdrawing or not mingling our ſelves. But where <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with,</hi> is not a probable ſign of <hi>countenancing of them,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; and there are more evident ſighes of diſcountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them manifeſted at that time, I ſuppoſe that phraſe then and there ceaſeth to ſignifie the withdrawing mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this chapter.

                  <p>Another phraſe is uſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Mark them who cauſe diviſions and offences contrary to the doctrine ye have learned, &amp; avoyd them.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed, ſome learned Interpreters make this exhortation parallel to that of our Saviours, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of falſe prophets</hi>—and that Chriſt his ſheep ſhould <hi>not hear, but fly from the voyce of the ſtranger and ſalſe ſhepheard.</hi> But others interpret it of diſcountenancing thoſe ſeditious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, by ſhunning communion with them. <hi>"From ſuch ye are to ſeparate, that others may not be deceived, by taking them for men as orthodox as any,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> paraphraſeth it. And <hi>Paraeus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Hos igitur, obſervari &amp; vitari, hoc eſt, ab Eccleſiae conſortio excludi monet Apostolus.</hi> And he paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels it with <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10.

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170420:36"/>the first and ſecond admonition, reject.</hi> Which is another Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe referring to the caſting of a perſon out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the Church.</p>
                  <p>In the 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. There are two other phraſes, both relating to the denying ſome communion to diſorderly Chriſtians. Many think theſe, eſpecially the first of theſe, belong not to any authoritative ſententiall excommunication pronounced and declared by the Officers of the Church, but ſhew the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lying on all Chriſtians to uſe their own diſcretion to diſcern and ſeperate from theſe offenders, ſo far as concerned them in their places and ſtations. The firſt of them is at verſe 6. <hi>We command you brethren to withdraw your ſelves from every brother that walketh diſorderly.</hi> And the later is at verſe 14. <hi>If any man obey not our word by this Epistle, note that man, and have no company with him that he may be aſhamed, yet count him not as an enemy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That alſo is a denying of ſome Chriſtian communion, which the Apoſtle exhorts to in the third Epiſtle of <hi>John,</hi> verſe 10, 11. <hi>If there come any to you and bring not this doctrine</hi> (that is, a doctrine contrary to the doctrine they had received before mentioned) <hi>receive him not into your houſe, nor bid him god ſpeed. For he that biddeth him god ſpeed is partaker of his evill deeds,</hi> the which Doctor <hi>Hammond</hi> interprets of the wicked and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatizing Chriſtian Gnoſticks, who taught men to deny Chriſt in time of perſecution.</p>

                  <p>From theſe hints the Scripture gives us <hi>about withdrawing communion from wicked Christians,</hi> duely peruſed, we may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) That <hi>Excommunication</hi> is no <hi>Scripture word,</hi> but is uſed by the Church to <hi>ſignifie all that juſt Eccleſiastical ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which over and beſides admonition, is to be uſed towards a wicked brother in reſpect of the Churches behaviour towards him, for the reclaiming of him, ond freeing the Church from the pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his intimate ſociety.</hi> For this deſcription doth agree to the texts before mentioned, as is manifeſt; and therefore if excommunication do ſignifie what is the ſenſe of thoſe texts, we ſhall not in the deſcription aforeſaid, miſconceive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of it.</p>
                  <p>That it is a part of Eccleſiaſticall ſeverity no one doubts, all the texts mentioned do evince that. That it is all that Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall ſeverity the Church and members thereof do make
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170420:36"/>uſe of, beſides admonition, will not, I think, be queſtioned; becauſe ſo generally Authors do make <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication</hi> the only divident members of Church cenſures in generall: and becauſe alſo neither the texts quoted, nor any other, do give ground for adding a third part of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure diſtinct from theſe. The reſt of the deſcription alſo is ſo plain in the texts, that I ſhall not inſiſt upon any of the particulars thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> that the object of Excommunication is a wicked Brother; that it is inflicted by the Church, and the members thereof, and that for the ends mentioned. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in <hi>juſt</hi> Eccleſiaſticall ſeverity, that it is done according to the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) Excommunication is nothing elſe but a <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> of a <hi>perſon at preſent from perſonal priviledges;</hi> &amp; not a <hi>cuttig him off ſimply from the Church.</hi> But (as I ſaid) a ſuſpending him from the priviledges, which as an orderly Church-member he might rightfully enjoy. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> renders <hi>extra communionem ejectio,</hi> an ejection out of the common union. <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>But though ſome excommunicate perſons are to be dealt with (in ſome eminent reſpects) as if they were cut off from, and were none of the Church, in reference whereto it is ordinary for Divines to ſpeak of them as <hi>cut off.</hi> Yet they are not <hi>ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply cut off</hi> from all <hi>union with the Church</hi> thereby, nor are ſo to he reputed; which may be evinced from the forementioned Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>For 1. he that is moſt <hi>excommunicate</hi> according to thoſe Scriptures, is to be <hi>but as an heathen,</hi> therefore not an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. <hi>Simile quâ ſimile non eſt idem.</hi> Now if he were <hi>ſimply cut off</hi> he ſhould be an <hi>heathen,</hi> and not onely <hi>as an heathen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Some excommunicate are to be accounted as <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.15. Therefore they are not reputed no <hi>Church-members.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Paſtors are to have a paſtorall care over the excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and they and other Church members are ſtill to <hi>admoniſh him</hi> as a brother.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. He is onely as a ſick perſon under cure and Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in order to his recovery. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. 1 Tim. 1.20. Now there is no phyſicking of a member ſimply cut off.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He is obliged to hear the word as a Church-member, and to receive admonitions in publick and private. For he is tied by vertue of the baptiſmall Covenant he hath profeſſedly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170420:37"/>into, to exerciſe himſelf in all the ordinances of Chriſt he hath opportunity for, as he hath for hearing the word as well as an heathen, with hope of receiving good thereby; and for ſome other ordinances it is ſaid that he looſeth at preſent <hi>poſſeſſionem</hi> rather then <hi>jus,</hi> as Mr <hi>Rutherford</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it, and explains it by the ſimilitude of a man having three houſes, who is for ſome offence confined to ſome one of them, and ſequeſtred from the other, ſo as he may not make uſe of them.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If he were made no Church-member by excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he ſhould upon his repentance be rebaptized: and ſo the Donatiſts rebaptized thoſe who came into their Societies, which was reaſonable enough upon ſuppoſition that they were before no members of the viſible Church, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaks. <hi>pag.</hi> 22. 23. and <hi>paſſim alibi.</hi> But the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate when readmitted are not to be rebaptized, therefore they were not reputed ſimply no Church-members whiles they were excommunicate.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. All (ſay they) are <hi>cut off</hi> but <hi>conditionally,</hi> if they do not repent; therefore they are not cut off till that condition be fulfilled, which cannot be before their death, for ought we know; the <hi>ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> or the <hi>ſin unto death,</hi> I ſuppoſe can hardly (if at all) be known to be committed by any individuall perſon, ſo as that the Church ſhould conclude him abſolutely irrecoverable. To ſay a perſon <hi>is cut off con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally,</hi> includes he is <hi>not ſimply and abſolutely cut off,</hi> whiles that condition of his finall impenitency is not exiſtent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Doctor <hi>Ricard Field</hi> of the Church, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>ch.</hi> 13, 14, 15. ſhewes how thoſe three ſorts of men who go out of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> Schiſmaticks, Hereticks, and notoriouſly wicked perſons who are excommunicate, do yet all of them remain ſtill <hi>parts of the Church of God.</hi> And concerning the laſt of them he thus ſpeaks <hi>ch.</hi> 15. <hi>Excommunication doth not wholly cut off the excommunicate from the viſible Church of God.</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>For they may and often do retain the intire proſeſsion of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Truth, together with the Character of Baptiſme, which is the mark of Chriſtianity, and ſo far forth notwithſtanding their diſobedience, still acknowledge them to be their lawfull Paſtors and Guides, by whoſe ſentence they are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that they would rather endure and ſuffer any thing, then ſchiſmatically joyn themſelves to any other communion.</hi>
                     </q> So he. And in the ſame chapter ſpeaking of ſuſpenſion, he ſaith,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170420:37"/>
                     <q>
                        <hi>The leſſer excommunication excludeth onely from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall pledges, and aſſurances of Gods love; which when it is pronounced againſt them that stubbornly ſtand out, and will not yeeld themſelves to the Churches direction and diſpoſition, is properly named Excommunication.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have the rather inſiſted on this, becauſe of two conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which wil naturally and eaſily flow from this doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That the ſcruple hinted by Mr. <hi>W. p.</hi> 133. and inſiſted on by others (in oppoſition to our abſtenſion, or ſuſpenſion) is manifeſtly frivolous and groundleſs. They ſay, if a parent turn not his children out of doores, he will not deny them bread; and apply their <hi>ſimile,</hi> that in like manner, thoſe who are not excommunicated, or not caſt out of the Church, ſhould not be denyed the Sacramentall bread in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Church-memberſhip (taken at large) doth not give right to perſons of years, to the Lords Supper. For then they who are cut off by any excommunication, ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; they being ſtill <hi>parts of the Church of God,</hi> as <hi>Field</hi> calls them.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>§. 7.</head>
                  <p n="3">(3.) Since excommunication is a withdrawing or rejecting of one from communion, hence it follows, that as communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more or leſſe, ſo this withdrawing (and therefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication) is capable of degrees, to be more or leſs. And ſome more notable degree may be denominated by one name, and another by another. Thus it was among the Jewes, the common nature of whoſe <hi>excommunication was, a withdrawing from ſome communion, as ours is.</hi> Many of the learned have deſcribed theirs, in the three ſpeciall degrees of it: as <hi>Schindler pentaglot. in voce</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>Gerrard. harm. Evang. c.</hi> 178. gives a ſummary account of them out of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Authors. The firſt was truly a ſeparation, or withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the ſecond was <hi>more ſolemnly ſuch. Quâ quis ſolenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in totius Eccleſiae conſpectu—excluſus eſt.</hi> The word <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenniter</hi> ſome ſuch man as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would catch and cavill at; as he doth <hi>p.</hi> 18. againſt ſuch a paſſage in my papers. <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is your Suſpenſion ſuch an Apocryphall buſineſs that it deſerves no ſolemnity in the managing thereof?</hi> Unto ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable flirts I ſhall not trouble my ſelf nor the Reader with any anſwer. But I inſiſt not in deſcribing wherein the ſeverall ſorts of their excommunication did conſiſt (there being
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170420:38"/>much difference among the learned in that. See Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) But that there were ſeverall ſorts; and in thoſe, that one was a ſeverer degree of excluſion or ſeparation and withdrawing from, then another. The four degrees or ſteps in the cenſure of excommunication among the Greeks for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, are mentioned by moſt who have written on this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie. The <hi>ſtantes, ſuccumbentes. audientes</hi> and <hi>plorantes.</hi> But the Gentlemen who oppoſe us alledge, that thoſe were <hi>ſteps in readmiſsion of the excommunicate,</hi> not <hi>ſteps or degrees in excommunication.</hi> But (though I confeſs this is an ingenuous anſwer, yet) methinks we may rationally inferre the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of proceeding by ſteps in excommunication, from that ſuppoſed lawfulneſs of admitting ſeverall ſteps of delivering out of excommunication. Sure I am, there is as much ground in Scripture, (and reaſon too as I apprehend) for the former as there is for the later.</p>
                  <p>And that conceit of excommunication under the notion of a <hi>diſmembring,</hi> and turning out or cutting off from Church-memberſhip, being (I conceive) ſufficiently and clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felled in the fore-going Section; this inference will appear much more evident and convincing. But I ſhall offer here theſe two conſiderations, for the further confirming of gradual excommunication, or putting out of Eccleſiaſticall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If there be nothing in the nature of excommunication it ſelf, which is againſt a graduall procedure in excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, nor any Scripture prohibition of it, and if it be not contrary to the generall Rule of <hi>doing all things in the Church orderly and to edification;</hi> then it is lawfull: But the former is true; therefore the later alſo. That there is nothing in the nature of excommunication againſt it, hath been ſhewed, in that <hi>withdrawing communion,</hi> which expreſſeth the nature of all excommunication is capable of degrees. That there is no Scripture prohibition hereof is to be reckoned upon, till ſome Scripture prohibition be produced, which I could never yet ſee, nor hear, ſo much as pretended by any. Nor is it contrary to the Rule of orderly and edifying tranſaction of affairs in the Church: ſince courſes of mildneſs and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are moſt likely to edifie, when they thwart not Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and Right, as thoſe do not which are not contrary to the Word, the Rule of Right and Juſtice.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, if a perſon may have no right to, yea ought to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170420:38"/>be debarred the Sacrament, who yet ought not to be turned out of all that private Chriſtian communion, which ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comunication deprives of; then there may be degrees of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, or putting one out of Eccleſiaſticall commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and particularly one degree of abſtenſion or ſuſpenſion, preceding (for ſome time) the withdrawing of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian communion. But the former is true; therefore the later. The Conſequence I ſuſpect not the deniall of; the Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſtands firmly upon theſe two pillars, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That no Chriſtian notoriouſly under groſs and ſcandalous wickedneſs, hath any right to the Sacrament, nor hath the Miniſter any rightfull commiſſion from the Donor or author of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Seals thereof, to adminiſter or give the Sacrament unto him. As ſuppoſe in point of faith, a notorious Heretique who denies a fundamentall of the Chriſtian Creed; or in point of manners, ſuppoſe one hath committed whoredome, and it is notoriouſly known; both theſe remaining viſibly impenitent, are uncapable of having the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per lawfully given unto them. And yet 2. an offender though ſo notorious as in the forementioned caſes, ought not forthwith to be rejected and turned out of all that Chriſtian private communion, which ſome excommunication deprives of. For the proof of the former of theſe two propoſitions, I muſt crave the Readers patience, and (God willing) in the following diſcourſe he ſhall find it (I hope) clearly and convincingly confirmed. The later of them I know none that deny. And there is Scripture-evidence for it. The heretick, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.10. is not to be rejected and caſt out of all that private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian communion, which ſome excommunication deprives of, till after the firſt and ſecond admonition, which are not to be given together and at one time, as all acknowledge; but at ſome diſtance. And a perſon is not thus to be rejected, till obſtinate: Now obſtinacy in wickedneſs (referring to faith or manners) cannot be ſuddenly manifeſted, but requires ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral admonitions being to be rejected by an offender, before he can be declared obſtinate.</p>

I know ſome extend it further, both for the excluſion from the word and prayers of the Congregation, and from almoſt any civill communion, except in ſome caſes of very neer relation to the excommunicate; yea, and then too, from praying with them, that the wiſe might not joyn in prayer with the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate husband. But this ſevere Doctrine I know not how to prove, and therefore muſt not aſſert it. I find indeed an <hi>Antichriſtian excommunication, Revel.</hi> 13.17. <hi>That none might buy nor ſell, ſave he that had the mark of the Beast.</hi> But <hi>it is dangerous</hi> (as one faith) <hi>to ſweep Chriſts floore with Antichriſts beſome.</hi> I know ſome of the Ancients ſpeak of the excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate as deprived of the ſuffrages and prayers of the Church. But then I think their meaning is, that they are not prayed for as the faithfull are; not but they were prayed for under the notion of impenitents, that God would give them true repentance, as the Church prayes for the converſion of the heathens. Some were thruſt out of the place of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but then moſtly thoſe places were (I conceive) private houſes where the Church had their meetings; of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to which there is not the like reaſon as there is of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to come to our aſſemblies, where the excomunicate may have a civill right to a ſeat as well as others. And where there were ſeats for the excommunicate diſtinct from the faithfull; there alſo were ſuch like diſtinct ſeats for the Catechumens and Heathens; whereby as it appears they were not excluded from the hearing of the Word, ſo it is alſo manifeſt they were not excluded any more then Heathens were, which is all contend for in this matter. The reverend Vindicator M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Humſreys, Vindic. p.</hi> 149. is ſo ingenuous as to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, he thinkes there's reaſon to come to compoſition with his worthy Antagoniſt about the admitting the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to the Word and Prayer, from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <q>
                        <hi>I could be willing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to compound the matter with one distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: Excluſion is either reall or relative. I ſhall leave it to him that will diſpute with</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Drake <hi>how the Church can exclude the excommunicate really from being preſent at the Word and Prayer; and it ſhall ſuffice me that they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:170420:41"/>cluded relatively however, ſo that though they may be preſent as heathen, yet are they cut off from all their interest in them, ſtill as members; ſo here.</hi>
                     </q> But why will not this handſome diſtinction be applyed, to the receiving the excommunicate to the Sacrament alſo <hi>really,</hi> though not <hi>relatively,</hi> if that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication did not eſſentially containe in it a withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from communion in the Sacrament, and not ſo in other Ordinances? And why ſhould our Brethren check us for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch a difference as they ſay we do betwixt Ordinances of equall ſanctity, <hi>viz.</hi> the Word, Prayer, and Sacraments; when they themſelves are here forced (as to admiſſion to them) to do the ſame thing? Excluſion from the Word and Prayer, I doubt not may be exerciſed on an excommunicate (and ſo on heathens) where no civil right he hath hinders not; in ſome caſes as prudence may direct. But then its an accidentall, and was not intended in the ſentence of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication conſidered in it ſelfe.

                  <p>In my ſixth particular concerning the ſtate of the Queſtion (in the <hi>M</hi> S. numb. 15, 16.) I made uſe of <hi>Ames</hi> his words to expreſſe my minde, <hi>viz</hi> that the leſſer degree of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which conſiſted in ſuſpenſion, hath place in the Church, not by any particular expreſs Inſtitution of Chriſt, but from equity, and the nature of the thing it ſelfe. There, firſt Mr. <hi>W.</hi> flouts me as quoting <hi>ſo low an Authority,</hi> and adjudgeth me to be <hi>ſtiled a private man for it.</hi> I had been more private but for him. But its evident I built nothing upon the authority of <hi>Ames</hi> here, no more then Mr. <hi>W.</hi> doth on the Author of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity miſtaken, or <hi>Torneſius</hi> which he quotes in his Epiſtle. Next, he gives us his obſervations concerning the time and order of <hi>Ames</hi> his workes; and that (in part) I thinke to ſhew my quotation of him to be amiſſe. And though he after mention his Tranſcriber of my copy; his diligence he commends, that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170420:42"/>none of the faults may be taken off my ſelfe; Let him excuſe his Tranſcriber as he pleaſeth, my paper quoted <hi>Ames, de Conſc: lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 29. But who could thinke this lofty <hi>Eagle</hi> would deigne to <hi>catch</hi> at ſuch poore <hi>flies</hi> as theſe. But he had leaſure enough it ſeemes, and a mind to ſay any thing, ſo it might be againſt me. And then becauſe <hi>Ames</hi> is not of my minde in all things about the ſubject of the power of excommunication, he tells the world I wrong <hi>Ames,</hi> in quoting that paſſage from him. When as our diſpute was purpoſely and expreſly ſeparated from the Queſtion about the ſubject of this power. <hi>Numb.</hi> 5, 6.</p>

                  <p>My ſeventh and laſt note was to this purpoſe, <hi>One particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar affirmative overthrows an univerſal negative,</hi> and therefore if I prove ſome in the Queſtion, in any caſe may be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I attaine my end. The which is ſo manifeſtly true to every freſh man, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath not the face to deny it; yet he chides about it extreamly, but moſt impotently, as if he would challenge our <hi>Wych-wallers</hi> to a ſcuffle with him. <hi>Your majeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſeverity — in a bead roll of words, as if you would charm the ſenſes of the vulgar with your rare skil in Logick. —to delude the ſimple, by fraudulent and illogical arguments,</hi> &amp;c. Thus his tongue runs at random, and he hath confuted me fluently, if his Reader will but do him this ſmall, very little favour, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him without proofe. But in the midſt of this ranting fit, he interweaves two impertinent Queſtions, <hi>Pag.</hi> 31. The firſt is this; <hi>Why all unregenerate, ignorant and ſcandalous members ſhould not be debarred as well as ſome? ſeeing they all (as well as ſome) do ſtand guilty of the ſame notorious cauſe of excluſion.</hi> To which I anſwer. 1. Some may be unregenerate, who are neither ignorant nor ſcandalous. 2. There are degrees of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſcandall, and therefore ſome may be more debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable than others. 3. I no where ſay that any notoriouſly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant or ſcandalous ſhould be admitted; but its ſufficient for the overthrowing their univerſall negative, <hi>None ſuch may be debarred;</hi> if I evince any may, let him look to it whether all ſuch may; my preſent province not putting me on the proofe thereof.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond Query is; <hi>Whether your pretented flagitious Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs may lawfully be whipt, before be he carefully convented or convicted, or after; If before, tell us by what Law, if not till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, Then you no wayes contradict our Aſſertion.</hi> As if I
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170420:43"/>had brought this ſimile to prove ſuſpenſion, when as I uſed it only to ſhew, that a particular affirmative overthrows an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall negative, <hi>viz.</hi> that if ſome flagitious Citizen may be whipt, then its falſe that none ſuch may; ſo it ſome ſcandalous Church-members may be ſuſpended, then its falſe that none ſuch may. The matter he queries as to ſome excommunication of ſcandalous perſons notoriouſly ſuch, although no juridical ſentence of an Eccleſiaſtical Judge hath paſſed on them to be ſuch, hath been anſwered in the laſt ſection. And now having diſpatcht his cavills againſt my explication of the Queſtion, and the management thereof; I ſhall attend him in the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelfe. But firſt let me take a little refreſhing.</p>

                  <p>TO my firſt ſyllogiſme (at <hi>numb.</hi> 21. of the Copy of my <hi>M S.</hi>) he anſwers <hi>p.</hi> 33. 1 by quarrelling with my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; and that in two reſpects. (Beſides his exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the phraſe [fully excommunicate], which hath been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled above) 1 that theres left out of it <hi>[They expreſſing their
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170420:43"/>deſire to receive, and offering themſelves:]</hi> But how vaine is this cavill, <hi>expreſſing the deſire he hath to receive any</hi> evaſion that <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it ſelfe?</hi> For 1. will he grant we may ſuſpend them who <hi>do not profeſs their deſire to receive, and do not offer themſelves?</hi> If ſo, then Church-memberſhip alone doth not give right to the adult for the Sacrament, and ſo his cauſe is marr'd. And he a little before, and in his Epiſtle, puts in the limitation of <hi>intelligent perſons</hi> at yeares, who only with him are admitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; ſo that if they are not intelligent, they are to be debarred, though they expreſs their deſire to receive, and offer themſelves. Now let Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhew what Scripture debarrs theſe from the Sacrament, and not from the prayers and other publique ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Church? But that he attempts not to doe. If he had, it were ten to one, the ſame proofes would bring in more limitations as well as that. But its ſufficient for him, for his part to cavill againſt others. 2 Againe, my argument pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds concerning the law of Chriſt debarring a viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſon; and then who ſees not that it concludes againſt him, whether he deſire and offer himſelfe to be admitted or no? And yet with theſe ſhifts it ſeemes he <hi>non-plust</hi> my paper, when he and it were together, and tells it he could ſtop its courſe here, and ſince it briſled not againe, he is heartned to let the world know, how brave acts he could do, if he would. 2 The other quarrell he hath againſt my concluſion is, That its a <hi>Tautology;</hi> and that is meanes that <hi>ſome baptized perſons at yeares ſuſpended may be ſuſpended. For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by [not fully excommunicate]. we underſtand your meaning to be [ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.]</hi> Suſpending may either denote the <hi>ſentence of debar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi> or the <hi>execution of that ſentence.</hi> To ſay ſome perſons cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured with abſtenſion or ſuſpenſion, may be ſuſpended, that is, have the Lords Supper denyd to them is no <hi>Tautology,</hi> no more then to ſay, a perſon cenſured with full excommunication, may be debarrd all publique Church ordinances (according to their ſenſe of it). But the pofition I undertooke after ſtating the Queſtion was this; <hi>viz. That its lawfull to debar ſome perſons the Lords Supper, who are baptized, and not warned to depart or kept from other publique ordinances, of hearing, praying, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the publique Congregations of the Church.</hi> And immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after this I began my argument, the concluſion whereof was, <hi>Some baptized perſons at yeares not fully excommunicated, may be ſuſpended from the Lords Supper.</hi> Whereby its manifeſt, that by [not fully excommunicate] I meant [not kept from all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170420:44"/>ordinances in the Church] which is their ſenſe of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. And is this a <hi>Tautology,</hi> ſome baptized perſons not kept from all publique ordinances, may be ſuſpended from the Lords Supper? My own judgement concerning full excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication hath been ſhewed before in the laſt Chapter. But what a pittifull buſineſs is this, that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſo much quarrels at the ſtate of the Queſtion, and ſometimes ſaith, I ſay what he holds himſelfe in it; and yet he would never rectifie the ſame in a line or two, though deſired (as I am informed) ſo to do, if it pleaſed him not, that we might have been agreed on that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we proceeded to diſpute upon it. But he ſeemes to imitate the crafty <hi>Gunner,</hi> who would alwayes ſay he aimed at that which he hit, but would never agree before he ſhot, what ſhould be the mark he would ſhoot at. Thus much concerning the concluſion of my Syllogiſme. Now he comes to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>major</hi> he ſaith <hi>p.</hi> 35. he <hi>grants with my elucidation thereof in ſuch general termes as they ſtand.</hi> Yet after he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelfe, and will (as he ſeemes to me) grant it upon condition that the granting of it may do no hurt to his own opinion. Whether this be not the ſenſe of his <hi>p.</hi> 36, 37, 38. let the Reader judge who will peruſe the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The proof of my <hi>Minor</hi> (which the Reader may receive if he pleaſe to turn back to the Copie of my paper <hi>M</hi> S. at numb. 24.) M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>W.</hi> ſets down in his p. 39. and gives us words upon it, p. 40, 41, 42, 43. without diſtinguiſhing upon, or denying any propoſition therein. He talkes much of <hi>Accade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall disputings.</hi> Be it known to him I am not ignorant of the method of Diſputation uſed in <hi>both our Univerſities.</hi> But if the <hi>Reſpondent</hi> (as he here makes himſelfe) ſhould in ſtead of giving a ſhort anſwer (as he ought) by denying or diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing upon the terms of either propoſition, run out into ſuch extravagancies as he here doth, he would (and that moſt deſervedly) be hiſt out of the Schools. He raps again at the diſtinction of <hi>greater</hi> and <hi>leſſer, fully</hi> and <hi>not fully</hi> excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; but impotently, without any proof offered againſt the ſame. And then leſt the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> formerly uſed, ſhould give any countenance to the diſtinction, he endeavours to clear the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who manifeſtly uſed that diſtinction. But the great fault is, that it is now uſed by us; &amp; what in them he excuſeth, in us <hi>Presbyterians</hi> is a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170420:44"/>crime, he can hardly find terms of aggravation and diſgrace bad enough to put upon it.</p>

                  <head>§. 3.</head>
                  <p>Let us then firſt ſee what was the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi> herein. And then how M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>W.</hi> takes us off from plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that, and I ſhall give my reply thereto. And firſt let us obſerve what was required by the Church of <hi>England</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in reference to the manifeſtation of the knowleledge of ſuch as were to be admitted to the communion, and their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding owning of the Chriſtian faith.</p>
                  <p>In the order for Confirmation, it's thought good, that none be confirmed, but ſuch as <hi>can ſay the Articles of the Creed, the Lords Prayer, &amp; ten Commandements, and can anſwer to ſuch questions of the Catechiſme as the Biſhop (or ſuch as he ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point) ſhall by his diſcretion appoſe them in. And this order is moſt convenient to be obſerved for divers conſiderations: Firſt, becauſe that when children come to years of diſcretion, and have learned what their God-fathers and God-mothers promiſed for them in baptiſme, they may then themſelves with their own mouth, and with their own conſeat, openly, before the Church, ratifie and confirm the ſame: And alſo promiſe, that by the grace of God, they will evermore endeavour faithfully to obſerve and keep ſuch things as they by their mouth and confeſſion have aſſented unto, &amp;c.</hi> And at the end of the Confirmation it's ordered, <hi>And there ſhall none be admitted to the holy Communion, untill ſuch time as he can ſay the Catechiſme and be confirmed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is the ſubſtance of what is required among us, Let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who come to communicate, ſhew that ever ſince they came to years, they thus perſonally owned the Chriſtian Faith, and I know no bar in the <hi>Presbyterial Government</hi> to their admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The Ordinance of Parliament no where requireth that all ſhould be examined now in order to their admiſſion. But that <hi>the ignorant are to be excluded;</hi> and that implies not (as ſome have over-haſtily concluded) that all are to be now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined. But onely that all not examined ſometime before, are to be examined now, and they onely; unleſs there be proofes (or at leaſt ſtrong preſumptions) of any their apoſtaſie from (or loſing the knowledge of) the faith they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time perſonally profeſſed.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>§. 4.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, for ſcandall; the order of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was manifeſt, that the ſcandalous ſhould be ſuſpended, though
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170420:45"/>not then fully excommunicated, or <hi>excommunicated majori excommunicatione,</hi> as the Canons ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>In the Rubrick before the Communion, it is thus ordered, <hi>If any of thoſe who intend to communicate, be an open notorious evill liver — the Curate ſhall advertiſe him, in any wiſe not to preſume to the Lords Table, untill he have openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf to have truly repented and amended his former naughty life, &amp;c. — The ſame order ſhall the Curate uſe with thoſe betwixt whom he perceiveth malice and hatred to reign, not ſuffering them to partake of the Lords Table, untill he knowes them to be reconciled. And if one of the parties ſo at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance, be content to forgive the other from the bottome of the heart — &amp; to make amends for that he himſelf hath offended, and the other party will not be perſwaded to a godly unity, — the Minister in that caſe ought to admit the penitent perſon to the holy Communion, and not him that is obstinate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt exhortation which is ordered to be read at <hi>certain times, when the Curate ſhall ſee the people negligent to come to the holy Communion,</hi> is moſtwhat <hi>verbatim</hi> and altogether in ſenſe, what Mr, <hi>W.</hi> hath prefixed before his Book under the name of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> and why he might not have quoted the Common-Prayer Book for it as well as <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly tell; but the Reader may eaſily gueſſe ſomewhat ſhrewdly at it. And for anſwer thereunto, as I ſee nothing therein againſt the ſuſpenſion pleaded for, ſo thoſe who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Common-Prayer, thought it no way thwarted their ſuſpenſion and leſſer excommunication; if they had, they would not have contradicted themſelves ſo groſsly, as to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert it in the Communion, where they ſo expreſsly give order for the debarring the ptophane, as you have already heard. And in their next exhortation to examine themſelves, repent and amend, they add, <hi>For otherwiſe the recieving the holy Communion doth nothing elſe but increaſe your damnation.</hi> And eſpecially in their third Exhortation. It's ſaid thus, <hi>Therefore if any of you be a blaſphemer of God, an hinderer or flanderer of his Word, an adulterer, or be in malice, or envy, or any other grievous crime, bewayl your ſins, and come not to this holy Table, leſt after the taking of that holy Sacrament, the Divel enter into you as he entred into Judas, and fill you full of impiety, and bring you to deſtruction of body and ſoul.</hi> Whereby it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the firſt exhortation to come, was made to them onely, who were ſuppoſed obedient believers; and here they who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170420:45"/>were diſobedient are warned to keep off, whiles ſo wilfully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient; and thoſe who were notoriouſly ſuch, were to be kept off by the Miniſter. But yet certainly the Curate did not fully excommunicate all them whom he was not to ſuffer to partake of the Lords Table, though in part he did eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally withdraw from them; as is more evident in the Canons of the Synod held at <hi>London</hi> in the firſt year of King <hi>James.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe three laſt Canons I have quoted, ſhew how cleerly they owned a degree of Cenſure, called by the name of <hi>ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> though it was in thoſe caſes to be inflicted by the <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</hi> But the former quotations ſhew how farre the Miniſter alſo was entruſted with a debarring from the Communion, notoriouſly prophane perſons, who might tender themſelves to receive. Now we are to heare, what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> alledgeth to cut
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170420:46"/>us off from our preſent pleading this order of the Church of <hi>England: The ſuſpenſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>taken up in the Church of England, in caſe of obſtinacy in ſome notorious crime, was the publique act of the Church and State, not inherent in a Miniſter (as a Miniſter) but derived to him by deputation; and cannot now be pretended to, the Common prayer book (which gave the power) being now aboliſhed.</hi> So he, <hi>p.</hi> 41.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>§. 6.</head>
                  <p>Firſt; Its to be obſerved that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here ſpeaks of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion taken up in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as if it were only <hi>in caſe of obſtinacy</hi> in ſome notorious crime; whereas its manifeſt, moſt of the paſſages before rehearſed out of the Canons and Common prayer booke, cleerly evince, that ſuſpenſion was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted for ſeveral crimes without reſpect to obſtinacy therein, and then obſtinacy and continuance in thoſe crimes, without viſible repentance and reformation, was puniſhed <hi>with greater excommunication,</hi> as the Canon it ſelfe ſpeakes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But as to the ſubſtance of his exception, I anſwer briefly thus for the overthrowing of it; Either the Common prayer booke <hi>was not aboliſhed</hi> by a lawfull authority ſufficient for the nulling and abrogating of that ſanction whereby it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly eſtabliſhed; <hi>or els it was. If it were not,</hi> then Miniſters by vertue of the Common prayer booke, may (as opportunity is offered) ſuſpend according to the Directions therein given them; which remaine ſtill in force, if not nulled by a ſufficient authority. But if the Common prayer booke was aboliſhed by a lawfull authority, ſufficient for the abrogating that ſanction whereby it was formerly eſtabliſhed, then certainly, they who had ſuch power to abrogate that government and order, had power alſo to eſtabliſh our ſuſpenſion. <hi>It belonging to the ſame power or authority to null as to make a law.</hi> And then the ſame ſuſpenſion (in ſubſtance) is delegated to Church Officers ſtill, in the Ordinance of 48 for Presbyterial Government where this is appointed, by the Lords and Commons, by whom only the Service booke was abrogated.</p>
                  <p>I have the rather hinted this for the ſatisfaction of ſome godly perſons who have not been well ſatisfied with the State proceedings, in reference to Church Government; who yet have an high eſteem of the former conſtitutions of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> And, me thinkes, where the ſame thing for ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is appointed and practiced, they ſhould not reject it. And now let the Reader if he pleaſe, judge, whether M. <hi>W.</hi> or
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170420:46"/>we <hi>behave our ſelves most like Miniſters of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (in reference to the degrees of excommunication, and ſpecially in reference to ſuſpenſion) <hi>the neglect whereof, he (out of Mr. P.) chargeth us with.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proceeds to carp at [may be] in my ſyllogiſme, when as yet [may be] was in the poſition I oppoſed.

But our <hi>Doctor reſolutiſſimus &amp; abſolutiſſimus,</hi> deſcends not ſo low as to obſerve the ſtate of the Queſtion; he had rather, it ſeemes, be ſhewing his Logick to his <hi>weaker conſciences</hi> (for <hi>whoſe ſatisfaction</hi> his title page deſignes his booke) and telling them, <hi>p.</hi> 43, 44. which are the <hi>ſubjects</hi> and the <hi>predicats</hi> in the <hi>Propoſitions,</hi> and the <hi>medius terminus in the ſyllogiſme:</hi> they will (it may be) applaud their Doctor, with an <hi>Egregiam veró laudem.</hi> But if any of his <hi>weaker conſciences</hi> meet with theſe lines, I am of opinion they will not ſo farre admire thoſe logical termes as to refuſe the plaine and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome proviſion I now offer them to ſhare with me, in the</p>

                  <p>THe confirmation of the <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition in my ſecond ſyllogiſme, (at <hi>numb.</hi> 25. in my <hi>M S.</hi>) Mr. <hi>W.</hi> repeats in his <hi>p.</hi> 44. where he hath ſuch jejune and lanquid exceptions, againſt ſome explications being inſerted in <hi>Parentheſes,</hi> and ſo ſeparated from the ſyllogiſme it ſelfe; that I judge it needleſs to make any defence againſt them. There being none (I thinke) who manage a diſpute in writing, who do not uſe the like. Although its true, in diſputations face to face, there is leſs need of them; any miſtake which might occurre about the meaning of the termes, being ſoone rectified by explicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof. The like frivolous complaint he makes of ſome various equipollent phraſes uſed, <hi>viz.</hi> [viſibly unbeleevers] and [ſuch as ought to be judged and taken to be unbeleevers] when as I had expreſly ſignified the equipollency of them, <hi>numb.</hi> 25. The propoſition I was to prove was, <hi>Thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are viſibly ſuch to whom the Lord would not (according to the revelation of his will in his Word) have the Lords Supper adminiſtred.</hi> Now my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in the ſyllogiſme I brought to prove this, was; <hi>Thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Christ are viſibly ſuch, to whom (according to the word of God) the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred.</hi> An ordinary Reader, I think, would ſee no difference betwixt [them to whom (according to the word of God) the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred], and [them to whom the Lord would not, (according to the revelation of his will in his word) have the Lords Supper adminiſtred]. But Mr. <hi>W.</hi> that he may ſeeme to ſee further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a milſtone than another can doe, hath ſpyed the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was (belike) at a great want for exceptions who takes up theſe; and conſidering his neceſſity, he may be better excuſed. <hi>Its better to pick ſtrawes than to doe just nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But at laſt he hath unbutton'd his eyes, and can perceive ſome ſtrength in my proofe when it hath been (he thinkes) beholding to him for a better dreſſe, <hi>p.</hi> 46. where he thus formes it; <hi>Thoſe who are viſibly unbeleevers, are viſibly ſuch to whom the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred. But thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are viſibly unbeleevers.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord

                  <p>Well, now he hath the <hi>honour</hi> (as he ſpeakes) to be <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> himſelfe, I hope he will be more civil in his anſwer, and not be captious againſt his own creature. <hi>Wherein now</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 47.) <hi>doth this argument advance your pretenſions, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage ours?</hi> and then explaining that Queſtion, or ſhewing that he is not at a want of other <hi>artificiall</hi> words to ſay the ſame thing againe as pompouſly, he addes, <hi>What evidence doth it artificially and intrinſecally give for you or againſt us?</hi> My concluſion was [thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are viſibly ſuch to whom (according to the word of God) the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred]. The concluſion he hath made for me is [thoſe who by word openly renounce the Lord Jeſus Chriſt are viſibly ſuch, to whom the Sacrament of the Lords Supper ought not to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred]. Let the Reader judge what material difference there is betwixt them. Yet he grants the latter, when he quarreld the former. But then as bethinking himſelfe, that the <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is mine, though the dreſs be his, he will now have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thruſt at it, and denies the <hi>Minor:</hi> yet not abſolutely but with diſtinction; now he attempts to play the part of a <hi>Reſpondent</hi> indeed. But what he might have ſaid, as befitted a Reſpondent in a few lines, he muſt ſpend many leaves upon (though not altogether) in the following part of his booke.</p>
                  <p>This being the very point of my argument, and this place moſt fit to conſider it more throughly, I ſhall here make my reply to him upon it, once for all.</p>

                     <hi>Viſible unbeleevers is not taken</hi> (ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 47.) <hi>in the ſame ſenſe in the Major and Minor. In the Major according to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and famous ſenſe of the Catholique Church for pagan Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, for men without, for non-receivers of Chriſtian doctrine, but poſitively ſtanding under the deluſion of ſome viſible Idoll or Idolls. In the Minor, according to your moderne Browniſme</hi> (thats one of the flowers he uſeth to dreſs me a garland with) <hi>and private ſenſe, for Chriſtians within the Church, baptized and adult; but manifestly defective in their Chriſtian Ethicks, though orthodoxall otherwiſe in all points of faith, and frequenters of our Church Aſſemblyes and ſolemnities, as profeſſedly of our Proteſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion in point of Religion and divine worſhip.</hi>

                  <p>By the way I might reply, What if theſe baptized adult perſons are not orthodox in faith, nor frequenters of our Church: aſſemblies and Solemnities? Are they then unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in the firſt ſenſe? or muſt there be a third ſenſe deviſed for them? The Reader will obſerve this confuſion. But if he had applied this diſtinction ſuch an one as it is, he had done ſomewhat becoming the place he hath taken upon him. But that he leaves at large. Well, ſince one good turn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires another, I will endeavour to make out his Anſwer as he (ere-while) thought to do my Argument. And it may be this: Viſibly unbelievers may be taken in a two-fold ſenſe. 1. For Pagan-infidels. 2. Morbid-Chriſtians, [under which term I ſuppoſe he will contain ſcandalous and notoriouſly-prophane Chriſtians, or elſe he ſaith nothing to the queſtion.] Now, take <hi>viſible unbelievers</hi> in the former ſenſe, for <hi>Pagan-Inſidels,</hi> and then I grant the <hi>Major.</hi> Thoſe who are viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unbelievers, that is, Pagans, are ſuch to whom the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred. And then I deny the <hi>Minor.</hi> All who in word openly renounce Chriſt, are not <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly unbelievers,</hi> that is, <hi>viſibly Pagans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But take <hi>viſible unbelievers</hi> in the later ſenſe for <hi>Morbid-Chriſtians,</hi> and then I grant the <hi>Minor.</hi> Thoſe who by word openly renounce Chriſt, are <hi>viſibly unbelievers,</hi> that is, <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid Chriſtians:</hi> But then I deny the <hi>Major,</hi> and ſay, That thoſe who are <hi>viſibly unbelievers,</hi> that is, <hi>Morbid Chriſtians,</hi> are not ſuch to whom the Lords Supper ought to be adminiſtred. I appeal to any judicious Reader, whether I wrong Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in this gueſſing at the application of his diſtinction and anſwer thereupon to my Argument. And indeed this elſewhere he gives us in as his ſenſe, many times over and over. p. 50. ſaith he, <hi>You miſ-judge in taking the Morbid Church members of our Parochial Aſſemblies to be unbelievers and Infidels poſitively, as Pagans, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>p.</hi> 51, 52, 53. and <hi>paſſim alibi.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170420:49"/>and the very ſtreſs of our controverſie will lye on this point, <hi>Whether to thoſe who are viſibly unbelievers in this ſenſe</hi> (I have proved to be a Scripture-ſenſe of the word, that is, as are <hi>viſibly in the way of actuall notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel,</hi> whether to theſe I ſay) <hi>the Lords Supper ought not to bè adminiſtred,</hi> though they be baptized, adult, intelligent, and not excluded other publique ordinances in the Church? I explicated <hi>[viſibly unbelievers]</hi> by [ſuch as are according to the word of God to be judged and taken to be thus unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.] Such explications Mr. <hi>W.</hi> cannot endure. Oh! how he puffs and ſtorms at them! <hi>p.</hi> 60, 61. and in very ſad earneſt calls them <hi>Bombaſt, &amp;c.</hi> But let us leave our brother to cool at his leaſure, and calmly conſider the thing it ſelfe now before us. And herein I ſhall deſign, 1. To premiſe ſome conſiderations, as introductory to what followes. 2. To determine and prove againſt Mr. <hi>W.</hi> the negative of the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion laſt propoſed. 3. To annex ſome cautions at the later end, for the further clearing and preventing miſtake in this doctrine I muſt inſiſt upon.</p>
                  <p>The conſiderations to be premiſed are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is certain, that a diſtinction ought to be made betwixt <hi>Believers,</hi> and thoſe we are to account and deal with as in the way of believing actually. The ſame is to be ſaid of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to be put between unbelievers, and thoſe we are to account and deal with as in the way of notorious diſobedience and unbelief.</p>
                  <p>As to the habit of faith, or unbelief, and the denomination a perſon may receive from the exiſtence or predominancy of either of them; we cannot certainly know, that any (beſides our ſelves) are ſo believers or unbelievers. But we may know who are viſibly in the way of faith or unbelief. And therefore I own and comply with the ſubſtance of what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith concerning the impoſſibility of our knowing who are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in reſpect of the habit, <hi>p.</hi> 55, 57. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Yea, I do not onely grant this in reſpect of the <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of justiſying and ſaving faith,</hi> but in reſpect alſo of <hi>a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall faith,</hi> that is, aſſent to the propoſitions of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, as truths, ſuch as the Divels may have, and the damned, who doubt not of the truth of the Goſpel. And if this be made out, I hope the Diſputes may be ſomewhat al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd, which are at preſent on foot, betwixt very learned and godly men, <hi>viz. Whether a dogmaticall faith, or juſtifying
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170420:50"/>faith entitle to the Sacraments?</hi> The one may with like reaſon be granted as the other, and both are attended with equall difficulties or inconveniences ſuppoſeable. I may as certainly know whom I am to account a juſtified believer, as whom I am to account <hi>a dogmaticall believer;</hi> yea, and moſt commonly (perhaps) as eaſily too. Is a perſons profeſſing his aſſent to the Articles of the Creed, or owning the Scriptures, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient character of his believing dogmatically or hiſtorically? So, is his profeſſing conſent, and cordiall ſubmiſſion to the doctrine of the Goſpel, as ſufficient and ready a note to us, of his being a juſtified believer? yet we cannot be certain he is of that perſwaſion in the Articles he profeſſeth aſſent unto; no more then we can be aſſured he ſincerely conſents to the ſame, according to his profeſſion of ſincerity. Is (on the contrary) a perſons diſclaiming the principles of the Chriſtian faith, a ſufficient token whereby we may be directed in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting him dogmatically or hiſtorically no believer? ſo his profeſſed renouncing of ſubjection to Chriſts Lawes, [<hi>quaſi dicat,</hi> I will not yet forſake my luſts that I may obey Chriſt] is a ſufficient note whereby we are to account him at preſent as out of the way of actuall juſtifying faith: Is a perſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Chriſts divinity, a note to us that he is not a dogmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call believer, though yet he profeſs he believes the Scriptures to be true and ſo contradicts himſelf? So is a perſons diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to, and actuall rebellion againſt the Commands of Chriſt, when notorious, a ſufficient token to us that he is not in the way of actuall juſtifying faith, although he doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in word that he believes ſincerely and obedientially, and ſo in this contradicts himſelf. But of this we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſay ſomewhat more beneath.</p>

Sometimes <hi>perſons</hi> are called <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>Saints,</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may be <hi>beleevers</hi> too, and <hi>ſuch like titles</hi> attributed to them, whiles here alive in this world, on the account of their being poſitively obliged (by their own promiſe) to holineſs, faith, and the ſervice of the true God; ſo as the Heathens and other Nations were not. Thus all the nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were devoted to God by their profeſſed acceptance of the Covenant of God tendred to them, were an holy people, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Kingdome, the Church of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo all thoſe perſons alive are now <hi>Saints,</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> and <hi>beleevers,</hi> who have ſolemnly taken an engagement upon themſelves, by their
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170420:50"/>promiſe made, to believe in Chriſt; and they are in Covenant, that is, they have by their own promiſe covenanted with God, and bound themſelves thereby unto his ſervice, ſo as Pagans are not. And no one can be ſure that that promiſe was not in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and therefore we cannot ſay abſolutely of any ſuch (though never ſo wicked, and cenſured too) that he is no Church-member; that is, that the hath not devoted himſelfe to Chriſt in truth. But now an heathen hath not (viſibly) devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelfe at all to Chriſt, and therefore cannot be a Church-member; yea though he be of Gods Elect. But for thoſe who have viſibly devoted themſelves to Chriſt, this indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter remaines on them, though they are apoſtates from the Covenant they have profeſſedly entred into; whether in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of doctrine or practice. Chriſt ſpeaking to the rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Jewes</hi> ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 8.54. <hi>It is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye ſay that he is your God;</hi> when yet he had told them before, that they were neither <hi>Abrahams</hi> children, nor had God for their Father, nor were of God, as they pretended, verſ. 39, 41, 42.47. The <hi>branches broken off</hi> viſibly from <hi>the olive</hi> (in ſome reſpects) <hi>are thus holy ſtill,</hi> Rom. 11.16, 17. and ſo are ſuch as are excommunicated, and ſuſpended from the perſonal priviledges of orderly and uncenſured Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. They are <hi>brethren</hi> in this ſenſe ſtill, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                  <p>A Church-member really is one who is ſincerely devoted to Chriſt, and we muſt account all ſuch againſt whom we cannot prove, that they never were ſo ſincerely devoted to Chriſts call. And then I thinke <hi>none alive must be rejected abſolutely</hi> from being Saints, beleevers, Chriſtians, Diſciples, and Church-members, <hi>who have been poſitively engaged to Christ;</hi> unleſs we could tell who had committed the ſin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, or had ſinned unto death in St. <hi>Johns</hi> ſenſe; the which is ſo difficult if not impoſſible to diſcerne, in particular perſons, that I need not have much reſpect thereto in this matter.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In this laſt ſenſe its true we may be certain (in reference to many or moſt) who are beleevers, and who are not. But that this is not the character and Rule of admiſſion to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, will appeare in the enſuing arguments; which I now haſten to.</p>

                  <p>In the ſecond place I deſigned to prove this Concluſion; <hi>That to thoſe who are unbeleevers in reſpect of actuall notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel,</hi> (whiles ſuch) <hi>the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="1">1 And my firſt Argument ſhall be grounded on Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his conceſſion, and the Introductory conſiderations before evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> grants that beleeving is the Rule for admiſſion, <hi>p.</hi> 56, 57. <hi>You ſay</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that knowledge who are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or who are not beleevers, muſt be the loadſtar of our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring or not adminiſtring the Lords Supper. We ſay</hi> in theſi, <hi>the ſame.</hi> And I have proved that neither a perſons being a <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leever habitually</hi> is the Rule of admiſſion, for that cannot cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be known; nor yet his being a <hi>beleever in reſpect of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive obligation layd on himſelfe to beleeve,</hi> though that may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be known; for then none could be debarr'd who have ever been baptized, yea or who otherwiſe have entred into a poſitive engagement to Chriſtianity. For the <hi>Jewes</hi> were <hi>Gods people and holy,</hi> not only by Circumciſion, but by the <hi>renewing of that Covenant,</hi> afterwards to <hi>take the Lord for their God, Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 29.10, 11, 12, 13. Now hence it cleerly follows, that the knowledge who are viſibly in the way of beleeving or obedience to the Goſpel they have poſitively (eſpecially by Baptiſme) obliged themſelves unto, is the Rule of admiſſion to the Sacrament. For the two former being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, no other but this can be aſſigned, that I know of. And then none can doubt that to thoſe who are unbeleevers in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel, the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ought not to be adminiſtred.</p>

If ſuch were to be excluded the Paſſeover, who were in viſible notorious diſobedience to the Law they were debtors poſitively unto by their Circumciſion, and other obligations; then the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred to them who are in a viſible notorious diſobedience to the Law they are debtors to by Baptiſme and other obligations.

                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:170420:52"/>This accords with thoſe words, verſ. 43. of this 12 Chap. <hi>No ſtrdnger ſhall eat thereof;</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee Paraphraſt</hi> renders it; <hi>Omnis filius Iſrael, qui fuerit Apoſtata, non comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det ex eo; no ſon of Iſrael, that is an Apoſtate, ſhall eat thereof.</hi> Thus we have an inſtance of debarring the Paſſeover for a pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not ceremonial which ſhould make him uncleane cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially, ſo as to ſeparate him from the company of others ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy. And this we ſhall have occaſion (I thinke) to improve further beneath. <hi>Mr</hi> Cotton <hi>in his grounds and ends of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Baptiſme,</hi> p. 11, to ſhew the hainouſneſs of the ſin of a baptized parent, who neglects to baptize his Infant, quotes this place, and ſaith, <hi>Surely in the old Teſtament a man was accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God as uncircumciſed himſelfe, if his children were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed.</hi> And according to the analogy Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds upon, (and reaſonably enough) in his ſolving the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion why Infants are not admitted to the Communion; taken fromthe not partaking of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Infants at the Paſſeover, <hi>p.</hi> 131. I ſay on the ſame analogy we may more particularly argue, If a circumciſed perſon formerly might not eat the Paſſeover if he circumciſed not his males, then a baptized pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent now may not eat the Lords Supper, if he bring not his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant to Baptiſme; and indeed ſuppoſing the command as cleere now for the baptizing of Inſants, as it was before for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of male Infants, the argumentation is ſtrong enough.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. I thus argue in the third place; The Sacrament ought not to be adminiſtred to them, whom we are no wiſe called, nor obliged to adminiſter to, upon the account of adminiſtring to beleevers. But we are no wiſe called, nor obliged to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacrament to unbeleevers, who are ſuch in the ſenſe, and in reſpect of notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel, upon the account of adminiſtring to beleevers. <hi>Ergo,</hi> the Sacrament ought not to be adminiſtred to unbeleevers, who are ſuch in the ſenſe, and in reſpect of notorious diſobedience to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel.

                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> may be ſhewed in ſundry like inſtances. The Scripture enjoynes us ſeveral duties in our behaviour towards the wicked and godly, the righteous and unrighteous, although we cannot certainly tell who theſe perſons are <hi>habitually</hi> and <hi>inwardly.</hi> But all agree (I thinke) that thoſe are to be taken and dealt with by us as ſuch, who are <hi>viſibly</hi> in the wayes of godlineſs or impiety. <hi>David</hi> deſcribing the practices of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. among others reckons this, ver. 4. <hi>In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but he honoreth them who fear the Lord:</hi> we muſt ſhun the company of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.115. we are to give to him that needeth, and not as in a way of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and neceſſary reliefe, to them who need not. But we know not ever who needeth, that craves our almes; he may coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit; and if it appeare he doth counterfeit, we are not obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor called to give unto him what belongs to the needy. We muſt know perſons to be Chriſts Diſciples by their loving one another, yet ſuch love cannot certainly be known to us to be in others. <hi>John</hi> 13.33. So alſo we are commanded, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.3, 4. If thy brother treſpaſs againſt thee, rebuke him, <hi>and if he repent forgive him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how ſhall I know when he repents? It follows, verſ. 4. <hi>If he treſpaſſe ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to thee ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him.</hi> There is a <hi>two-fold forgiveneſs,</hi> 1. that which is oppoſed to <hi>hatred, grudges, and unjust deſire of revenge</hi> againſt him who hath wronged us. Thus we are to forgive him who treſpaſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, whether he repent or no; we are to love our enemies remaining ſuch. 2. That which is oppoſed to the <hi>not receiving him into familiarity,</hi> and tokens of intimate and encouraging friendſhip as formerly. And thus we are not bound to forgive, unleſs he who hath treſpaſled do repent; that is, do manifeſt his repentance; and his <hi>ſaying he repents,</hi> may be a manifeſtation thereof ſufficient to us, that we may ſo far acquieſce therein, as to be obliged to forgive him in this later ſenſe. But here <hi>Calvins</hi> caution is uſeful, <hi>Addendum eſt</hi> (ſaith he on the place) <hi>Chriſtum non privare fideles judicio, ut ſlultè ad verbulum unum creduli fint; ſed tantum velle aequos eſſe &amp; humanos, ut reſipiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centibus manum porrigant, ſi modo apparet ipſos ex animo ſibi in peccat is diſplicere— ſed quoties probabile Agnum conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionis dederit peccator, admitti vult Chriſtus ad reconciliationens,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170420:53"/>ne repulſae fractus deficiat.</hi> Now he who hath taken away my goods, and ſaith he repents, and yet will not, having them in his hand, reſtore them to me; by his wicked and wilfull de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, overthrowes the credibleneſs of his verball profeſſion; and his ſaying, <hi>I repent,</hi> obligeth to this ſort of private forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe I have mentioned, no otherwiſe, then as it is a probable token of his ſerious repentance. Nay, though he is a wiſe ſon (as the proverb goes) who knows his own father, yet is every child obliged to honor both his parents. So manifeſt is it, that we may be, and are obliged in ſeverall duties to thoſe perſons as ſo and ſo qualified, whom we cannot certainly know to be ſuch, under the notion whereof we tender thoſe reſpects to them. But as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that receiveth a Prophet, or Diſciple, in the name of ſuch</hi> (that is, who probably appeares to be ſuch) <hi>ſhall have his reward:</hi> ſo here in theſe and ſuch like caſes. But when perſons appear to be in a way viſibly contrary to theſe qualifications on which is founded any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in ſundry reſpects, who doubts that our obligation to perform ſuch offices to them, then ceaſeth? When therefore ſuch as by baptiſme have bound themſelves to believe, that is, to receive and obey the Goſpel, do yet notoriouſly appeare to be <hi>unbelievers</hi> in reſpect of their actuall diſobedience to the Goſpel, we are not obliged to adminiſter the Sacrament to as <hi>believers:</hi> As on the contrary, when baptized perſons own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their baptiſmes, appeare not to be in a way of notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel, we are bound to adminiſter to them as believers, whether they are really and inwardly ſo or no.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. A fourth argument may be grounded on the forme of adminiſtration, wherein the Miniſter ſaith to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Take, eat, this is the Body of Chriſt which is broken for you.</hi> So Luke 22.19, 20. <hi>And this Cup is the New Testament in Chriſts blood which is ſhed for you.</hi> In the Common-prayer book it is, <hi>Take, eat this, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that Chriſt died for thee. Drink this in remembrance that Chriſts blood was ſhed for thee.</hi> The Directory ſaith in <hi>Pauls</hi> words, <hi>This is the body of Christ, which is broken for you.</hi> Whence I argue, The Lords Supper ought not to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to them to whom theſe words may not be ſpoken particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the adminiſtration of it. But to ſuch unbelievers as are ſuch in reſpect of their notorious viſible diſobedience to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170420:53"/>the Goſpel, theſe words may not be ſpoken particularly in the adminiſtration of the Sacrament: Therefore to them the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred. The <hi>Major</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove exception: For thoſe ought not to be admitted, to whom the Miniſter may not ſay what he ought to apply to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. The <hi>Minor</hi> I ſhall further inſiſt upon, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to clear. In order whereto I muſt enquire into the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the foreſaid words to be uſed in the form of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration.</p>
                  <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that theſe words conſidered ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely and in themſelves, may be interpreted more generally either, 1. of Chriſts being ſacrificed for the redemption of all the world of mankind, the <hi>genus humanum;</hi> and that not onely <hi>ſufficienter</hi> (for that which is paid for the redemption of perſons, is not <hi>ſtrictly</hi> a price, becauſe it is ſufficient in its own nature to be a worthy and valuable conſideration to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem them) but <hi>conditionally</hi> by way of <hi>Chriſts intention alſo</hi> to redeem mankind, that is, upon the condition of believing: So that this Goſpel may be preached to every humane creature (not ſo to any lapſed Angel) <hi>He that believeth and is bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed ſhal be ſaved.</hi> God ſo loved the world, &amp;c. Or, 2. (if this pleaſe not, the fuller explication whereof may be ſeen in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Camero,</hi> and the larger diſquiſition of it in the acute <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myraldus</hi>) Chriſt dyed for all, in that he bought all, to be Lord and Ruler over them, as Mediator in the Kingdome he hath received by diſpenſation from the Father to be Lord of all. Or, 3. as he procured ſome common benefits for all. But I conceive it's manifeſt, theſe words of adminiſtration conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as words of adminiſtration in the Sacrament, and ſo with ſpeciall relation to the Sacrament, cannot be underſtood in ſo large a ſenſe, q d. <hi>Chriſt died for thee if thou will believe,</hi> or on condition of thy faith; or Chriſt died for thee, or was broken for thee, that he might have power over thee as Lord and Judge, or to purchaſe ſome common benefits for thee, as he did for all mankind. For ſo they might be applyed to heathens, yea to the moſt wicked of heathens, and ſuch as are viſibly in the moſt nototious oppoſition of, and apoſtaſie from the very name of Chriſtianity; and ſo this ſhould be no more an application of comfort to the viſibly moſt worthy receiver, then is applicable to the vileſt Mahumetan on the face of the earth.</p>

                  <p>There is another as narrow a ſenſe put on the words, as the former is large, and that is to reſtrain them, to the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the benefits of Chriſts death <hi>abſolutely</hi> to every receiver. q. d. <hi>This is the body of Chriſt, in which thou hast ſaving inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. As ſurely as thou receiveſt the outward ſignes, ſo certainly is the inward grace there alſo.</hi> But this cannot be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning here, becauſe no Church nor Miniſter can certainly tell who thoſe are who are ſincere believers, who onely are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers abſolutely of the remiſſion of ſins purchaſed by Chriſts broken body, and his blood made over unto them. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains onely a third ſenſe (that I know of) which is a <hi>mean</hi> betwixt the two former. And this is to be founded on the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ſenſe of other ſuch like paſſages in Scripture, and the nature of the Lords Supper it ſelf. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are are ſanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our God.</hi> And to the Epheſians, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1, 8, 19, 20, 21, 22. <hi>You hath he qu ekned who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins; by grace ye are ſaved through faith,</hi> chap. 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Abundance of ſuch paſſages there be in Scripture, where it is manifeſt the Apoſtle applies to them the comforts and benefits of ſincere believers, as theirs; and yet he knew not their ſincerity abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely. It muſt needs then be, that according to his knowledge of their ſincerity, ſo was the application he makes to them of the priviledges annexed onely to ſincerity, that is, according to the judgement of the Church which received them as ſuch probably. If they were ſuch as Eccleſiaſtieally they appeared to be, then all theſe benefits were really theirs. And hence the baptized are ſaid to be illuminated and ſanctified, becauſe in the judgement of the Church they were ſuch, who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to baptiſme, who if they were really what they were by the Church eſteemed to be, were certainly ſanctified and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned. ſo I humbly conceive the meaning of theſe words, <hi>This is the body of Christ which is broken for you,</hi> is this. q. d. If thou be really what the Church taking thee into her fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip judgeth thee to be (whiles it being in a capacity to judge, hath not judged thee contrary) then thou art certainly partaker of the inward grace of this Sacrament. All the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefits flowing from Chriſts blood, are thine. If thou art ſincere, as the Church or Miniſter hopes and judgeth of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170420:54"/>thee in admitting thee, then Chriſt is thine really. Not <hi>if thou wilt believe Chriſt is thine;</hi> but <hi>if thou now doſt ſincerely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as thou now appearest to do;</hi> which ſuppoſeth that he is taken for one who doth ſincerely believe by them who regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly admit him, (the governing Church or Miniſter alone in ſome caſes.) How incongruous would it be to ſay to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell who was erewhile viſibly in Armes, and was breathing out treaſon againſt his Soveraign, and hath not yet viſibly recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſame, and therefore is ſtill viſibly in the way of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, how incongruous would it be to ſay to ſuch a one, If thou art a good ſubject, the King is thy friend? And it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in part by what hath been before quoted from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer book, and Canons, that the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which uſed that form of adminiſtration, <hi>Christ died for thee,</hi> underſtood it as to be applied onely to the viſibly juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, becauſe they excluded the notoriouſly diſobedient (though not fully excommunicated) and warned all to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain who lived and allowed themſelves wilfully in ſecret ſins, which the governors of the Church could take no cognizance of. Thus in the third Exhortation, after the warning of the wicked perſons, that they come not to the Lords Table. In the invitation following, thoſe onely are called who are <hi>truly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent.</hi> To them it's ſaid, <hi>Draw neer and take this holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to your comfort.</hi> They never ſeemed to call or encourage the prophane to come to be converted from that their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe, although God may work ſuch an effect by the Sacrament, even in an heathen if he were (though finfully) admitted.</p>

                  <p>All Divines, I think, have held, that in the Sacrament there is an application of comfort to the communicants parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly. As the Miniſter is to give each their portion in due ſeaſon, and ſo is prudently to hold forth and apply the promiſes to thoſe he judgeth humbled, and capable of having them fitly and ſately applyed to them; and not to the viſibly impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in that ſtare (except ſo as to encourage them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, that they may be capable of them.) So in the miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, comfort is applied to the communicants, upon ſuppoſition of their being in ſuch a capacity for it <hi>really,</hi> as to the Church they are <hi>apparently</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, if the delivering the Sacrament to a communicant in this form, <hi>Chriſt dyed for thee,</hi> or the like words, be an
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170420:55"/>application of the richeſt Goſpel-promiſe to him, at that inſtant for him to lay hold upon for his preſent comfort, and is ſo intended by the miniſtrator of the Sacrament to him, then he is ſuppoſed in the judgment of the Church which receives him, or in the prudentiall judgement of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter (where there is no governing Church to involve his particular judgement in theirs) that he is one who at preſent is in a capacity to believe that he hath ſaving inrereſt in Chriſts body and blood exhibited there unto him ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and ſignally, which they muſt judge of, not by his being a Church-member in the largeſt ſenſe, (from which excommunication doth not ſimply cut him off) but by his being viſibly (to them) in the way of actuall obedience to the Goſpel he profeſſeth. So much for this Argument.</p>

                  <p>I Proceed to my fifth and chiefe Argument, in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof we ſhall derive cleere light from the holy Scriptures. And it may be thus framed; The Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred to them who do viſibly and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly want that faith which is neceſſarily required to be viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preſent in them who may be lawfully admitted thereunto.

Such as viſibly want that faith which is neceſſarily required, to be viſibly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the adult, who may be lawfully admitted to Baptiſme, do viſibly want that faith which is neceſſarily required to be viſibly preſent in them who may be lawfully admitted to the Lords Supper.

                  <p>The major propoſition here is proved by the analogy (which divers have ſhewed) betwixt the two Sacraments; there is the ſame Covenant ſealed in both, and the ſame benefits confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (at leaſt) on the adult in both. And if any make any difference herein, the advantage is given to the Lords Supper, and ſo our argument is more ſtrong, <hi>a minori ad ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus.</hi> But I ſhall not ſiay on this; ſince the learned and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous Mt. <hi>Humphreys</hi> (the ſtrongeſt oppoſer of the ſuſpenſion our controverſie is now about, that I have ſeene) hath granted that <hi>Adult is eadem eſt ratio utriuſ<expan>

                  <p>Here are indeed ſome paſſages I am far from conſenting to; as that <hi>Baptiſme admits perſons to be Church-members,</hi> when as the great argument for the Baptiſme of children goes upon a contrary poſition, <hi>viz. That Church-members</hi> (whom no bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring crime is charged upon) <hi>may be baptized.</hi> Therefore they are Church-members before Baptiſme; though in that their Church-memberſhip is ſolemnly ſignified and publiquely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. And his concluding it not needful to have this confeſſion made before a perſon be (firſt) admitted to the Lords Supper, as it was before perſons adult were admitted to Baptiſme, will not hold: unleſſe he could ſhew, where perſons baptized in infancy, were (or ought to be) in Scripture ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper, without a perſonal recognition of the Chriſtian faith. But becauſe this is not particularly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in any Scripture example, we muſt needs argue by ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to Baptiſme about it. There is the ſame reaſon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a profeſſion of faith from one baptized in infancy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is firſt admitted to the Lords Supper, as there is for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it from the adult for their Baptiſme; eſpecially ſuch as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and others, who were many years Chriſtians in profeſſion before they came to be baptized; and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> who were Church-members before their being baptized. But to let theſe things paſſe here. Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> grants the Rule, ſo far as I intend now to make uſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it <hi>holds in the maine, that profeſſion of faith</hi> (hiſtorical ſaith he, but moſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably wrong) <hi>is the Rule for admiſſion to both Sacraments;</hi> only in the baptiſme of the adult it was verbal profeſſion, and at receiving, he ſaith, their very coming to receive is their profeſſion. Though he maketh the manner of teſtifying the faith required in adult perſons to be baptized, different from the manner requiſite for teſtifying the faith required in him who is to be admitted to the Lords Supper; yet he grants (if I underſtand him) that what faith was the condition of applying Baptiſme, is the condition of admitting to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; which is all I require. And therefore the viſible want
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170420:56"/>of that faith is a bar to his receiving, which would be a bar to the baptiſme of the adult.</p>

                  <p>It now remaines that I prove the <hi>Minor</hi> which was this: Unbeleevers by notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel do viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly want that faith, which is neceſſarily required to be viſibly preſent, in them who may be lawfully admitted to Baptiſme; and the truth of it, is thus made out; If it were a viſibly actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juſtifying and ſaving faith, which was neceſſarily reqired in Scripture as the condition of perſons adult, their admiſſion to Baptiſme, then the laſt recited minor propoſition is true. But the Antecedent is evident, therefore the Conſequent muſt be granted. I ſuſpect not that any will deny the conſequence; my work will lye in demonſtrating the Antecedent; the which I ſhall thus endeavour.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Such a viſible faith as is joyned with a true and ſaving vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible repentance, is an actual juſtifying faith viſibly. But the Apoſtles ſo required ſuch a viſible faith as is joyned with a true and ſaving viſible repentance. Therefore they required a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly actual juſtifying faith, neceſſarily as the condition of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Baptiſme. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized for the remiſſion of ſins;</hi> that was the condition <hi>Peter</hi> tendred to them; and that it was viſibly cloſed with by them is manifeſt, upon which they were baptized. <hi>ver.</hi> 41. <hi>Then they who gladly received his word</hi> (eſpecially the doctrine of <hi>repentance</hi> he had preached to them, for their crucifying Chriſt, and of faith in Chriſt as the true Meſſias) <hi>were baptized.</hi> Here is the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Baptiſme to them, upon that condition ſuppoſed to be viſibly performed by them; which therefore excludes them who cloſe not viſibly with this condition. If any ſay (as its uſually ſaid) who can know a ſincere beleever? Let them ſay how <hi>Peter</hi> could tell who repented, yea and not only who <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the word,</hi> but <hi>gladly</hi> received it; ſuch as viſibly did ſo, he muſt take for ſuch, or deal with as ſuch; who can honour a godly man to love him; or who repents to forgive him?

                  <p>Having thus ſhewed (I thinke convincingly) that <hi>Philips</hi> propoſal of <hi>beleeving with all the heart,</hi> as a condition of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, did intend more then a bare hiſtorical, dogmatical faith, which may be, and is in Divels. Now, I thinke, it will not be bogled at, That the Eunuch his profeſſion of faith, was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by <hi>Philip</hi> as coming up to that demand, and though the Divels often ſaid the ſame or like words, as the Eunuch here expreſſeth his faith by, and wherein <hi>Peter</hi> made that glorious confeſſion, which Chriſt ſo much magnifies, <hi>Math.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. and on which Chriſt will build his Church; Yet theres no doubt <hi>Peters</hi> faith in that, was more than dogmatical, and what might be in Divels: and the acknowledging of the (then) hardeſt Article of the Chriſtian faith, to wit, that <hi>Jeſus was the Christ or Meſſiah,</hi> was a probable teſtimony, that the men who profeſſed this, would not ſtick at taking him for their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.

                  <p>Thus much for anſwer to <hi>one of the exceptions</hi> made againſt the force of our preſent argument; <hi>The other is,</hi> that <hi>Philip re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more then was neceſſary to his admiſsion to baptiſme,</hi> as hath been before explained. To this I anſwer. There are cleare teſtimonies that <hi>Philip</hi> required <hi>this beleeving with all the heart,</hi> as a neceſſary prerequiſite condition of the Eunuchs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170420:58"/>admiſſion to baptiſme, if we will but allow <hi>Philips</hi> and the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs words to be the Interpreters of their own minds, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out miſerable torturing and forcing of them to abuſe their Maſters. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Eunuch ſaith, <hi>What hinders me to be baptized?</hi> To this Queſtion <hi>Philip</hi> anſwers, <hi>If thou beleeveſt with all thine heart, thou mayſt:</hi> Therefore in anſwer to the Queſtion is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, <hi>If thou dost not beleeve with all thy heart, thou mayſt not;</hi> and then no more but neceſſaries are here required. (I have often enough explained this to be meant of viſible beleeving with all his heart.)</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Eunuch ſaith, <hi>Here is water, what hinders me to be baptized?</hi> He enquites therefore, if there were nay ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect now as ſhould ſo bar his being baptized, as the want of water would have done, if that had not been there then; therefore the Eunuch enquires, If there were any effectual bar now againſt his baptiſme.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To which <hi>Philip</hi> anſwers as we have heard; <hi>If thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeveſt with all thy heart, thou mayſt,</hi> viz. <hi>be baptized: now there is water at hand, and Philip an Evangeliſt,</hi> (no doubt Commiſſioned to diſpence this Sacrament) <hi>Theres nothing now to hinder, except there ſhould be a want of a viſible ſincere and hearty beleeving, and that ſhould hinder thee. If this do not (but rather thou by thy profeſsion approvest thy ſelfe thus to beleeve) thou mayst.</hi> I appeal to any Judicious Reader; whether this be not the genuine, faireſt and eaſieſt ſenſe of the words; and how tortured &amp; ſtrained is that the Exception puts upon them. As if a man coming to one authorized to marry people, ſhould ſay; Sir, <hi>heres a fit match for me, what hinders me to be marryed;</hi> and then the Commiſsioner ſhould ſay, If <hi>yee both are agreed with all your hearts yee may.</hi> Is not this their appearing ſerious agreement, ſignified (whether they do inwardly and ſincerely ſo agree or no, the marrier looks not after,) the neceſſary prerequiſite condition, which being viſibly wanting, would hinder his attompt to marry them. And if he ſhould ſay, (as the Reverend Objector ſuppoſeth, paralel to this text) If ye feare the Lord, ye may marry; how unſutable would it be to the Queſtion propoſed by them?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If ſuch plaine words as theſe <hi>[What hinders me to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized? If thou beleeveſt with all thy heart, thou mayst]</hi> may be expounded, <hi>q. d.</hi> [To that Queſtion of thine, <hi>What hinders me to be baptized?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>Though thou do not viſibly beleeve
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170420:59"/>ſincerely, thou mayst</hi>]. I know not what ſecurity we ſhall have for the ſenſe of almoſt any Scripture; eſpecially where no ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity forceth us to depart from the manifeſt genuine uſuall proper ſenſe of the words.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall leave it to the Readers ſerious thoughts, whether I have not proved, that <hi>Philip</hi> required a viſible (beleeving with all the heart, or) juſtifying faith, as the neceſſary condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Eunuchs admiſsion to Baptiſme; and then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that a perſons beleeving in reſpect of ſuch a faith as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notes viſible obedience to the Goſpel, is the Rule of admiſsion of the adult to Baptiſme, and by conſequence of ſuch only to the Lords Supper, as are viſibly ſo qualified. One thing more I ſhall obſerve, before I paſs this, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Eunuchs Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion was (as ſeemes) directly and primarily an enquiry, upon what termes <hi>Philip</hi> would baptize him, and ſo refers to his right to baptiſme <hi>in ſoro eccleſiae;</hi> and therefore I have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted the <hi>beleeving with all the heart</hi> in <hi>Philips</hi> anſwer, to be meant of a viſibly ſincere beleeving, according to the Rules <hi>Philip</hi> was to judge by, who were to be treated as ſincere belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And to refer it to the <hi>forum Dei,</hi> as diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>ſorum eccleſiae,</hi> is not (ſo far as I can diſcerne) proved nor encouraged by the context.</p>

                     <hi>CAution</hi> 1. When I ſpeake of viſible ſaving faith, which I explaine to be a viſible conformity or obedience to the Goſpel, I do not refer (primarily) to the habit of ſaving faith, but the actual exerciſe thereof. And the viſible unbeleefe, on the contrary, refers not to the habit of it, but the prevailing preſent actings and fruits thereof. For we cannot judge every one hath not the habit of ſaving or juſtifying faith, who is at preſent viſibly in a way inconſiſtent with the exerciſe thereof.
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170420:60"/>But as in the Sacraments, eſpecially remiſsion of ſins is ſealed: ſo thoſe are ſuppoſed at preſent capable of it, who are admitted unto them. Now as Remiſsion of ſins is promiſed to us, (to us I ſay, not now conſidering what is promiſed to Chriſt for us) only on the condition of faith and repentance; ſo the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of remiſsion or juſtification, may be expected only, on the ſame termes, According to our continued Petition, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes, as we forgive our debiers.</hi> Which our Saviour reiterates, <hi>poſitively,</hi> v. 14. <hi>If ye forgive men their treſpaſſes, your Father will forgive you:</hi> and <hi>negatively,</hi> v. 15. <hi>But if yee</hi> (yee my Diſciples, though at preſent juſtified ones) <hi>forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive you.</hi> So that judicious grave Divine <hi>Muſculus</hi> ſaith, <hi>loc. com. de remiſſione. p.

                  <p>I confeſs upon this doctrine here occurres a great Queſtion; Whether <hi>David</hi> whiles actually impenitent under his groſs ſins, was unpardoned, and ſo unjuſtifyed? ſince all pardon and the continuance thereof is to be expected only on the condition of faith and repentance. It muſt be acknowledged, this is a point of great difficulty, to ſpeak to it clearly and conſiſtently: The obſcurity whereof hath occaſioned different thoughts in the godly learned for the explication of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Some have ſaid, thoſe groſs ſins do extinguiſh grace, and are inconſiſtent with the very habit of faith, and ſo null pardon; which they apply to the caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> till they did repent, and ſo the work of regeneration was begun anew again in them, as it was in their firſt converſion. To which they think that paſſage, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.10. affords ſome illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. <hi>Create</hi> in <hi>me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi> but although it may be ſo to their ſenſe, and the ſame omnipotent power of Gods grace is to be put forth for their recovery, as was for their firſt converſion: (Which two reaſons may be ſome account of the Pſalmiſts expreſſions;) yet I conceive, it's plain, that the feed of grace is never to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally deſtroyed in them, but is immortall, although it may as winter-corn, lye (we know not how) long under the clod. Others ſay, all the ſins of the godly are ſins of infirmity (the perſons committing them, being not <hi>dead in ſin,</hi> as an unro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170420:60"/>man is, but onely diſeaſed and wounded, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not committed with full conſent; The habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall reſolution and frame of their ſouls, being againſt thoſe ſins which they are ſometimes over-born with. But this ſeems contrary to many plain Scriptures, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.6, &amp;c.</p>

               <div n="3" type="section">
                  <head>§. 3.</head>
                  <p>Between theſe two extreams ſome have laboured to find a middle way more ſafe. I ſhall alſo adjoyn my poor endeavours in the following particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I take it for certain, that there is in the godly a ſeed, or habit of ſanctifying grace, which (when they are at the loweſt ebb, in regard of the fruits and acts of it) is never totally extinguiſhed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.28. &amp; 17.20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.32. And this is an active principle, ready to put them on to actuall faith, repentance, love, and obedience. In regard whereof, the habitual frame of <hi>Davids</hi> heart was fot God more then for ſin, even when his ſin hindred the actings of grace, therefore he never ceaſed altogether to be a penitent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever; and therefore was never altogether caſt out of the ſtate of pardon and juſtification by thoſe ſins (though hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous) which he did not finally continue in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Notwithſtanding this their ſtate of juſtification and pardon continued, yet the godly may fall, and be under actuall guilt by groſs ſins whiles not particularly repented of. And that not onely ſuch guilt as may oblige them to temporal judgements, (which often are for the ſame inflicted on them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29, 30, 31. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14.) But alſo the preſent actuall guilt of eternall wrath and damnation. For he may fall into ſuch ſins, wherein if he finally continue, he cannot expect to be ſaved, but is bound to think he ſhall periſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing therein, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.3. and 2. wherein, afterward he repenting, acknowledgeth God might juſtly have caſt him off in his ſin, and damned him for it; notwithſtanding his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer intereſt in Chriſt. Now theſe accuſations of Conſcience are true, grounded upon the threatnings of the word of God againſt ſuch as are (any while) particularly impenitent under ſuch ſins. Therefore the guilt of conſcience charged on him, was really on him at that time.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And he may fall into ſuch ſins, as the Church may juſtly retain and bind (as it is conceived the inceſtuous Corinthian was godly before,) and theſe <hi>are bound in heaven:</hi> therefore
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170420:61"/>their ſins at that preſent are not remitted in heaven.</p>

               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>§. 4.</head>
                  <p n="3">3. How theſe poſitions (both which ſeem manifeſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) ſhould agree together, and not contradict one another, is the great difficulty. That learned Divine (before named) moſt happy in ſolving of difficulties, though he ingenuouſly confeſſe himſelfe much in the dark here; yet inclines to this anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> That pardon belongs not onely to actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, but to habituall. And ſo <hi>David</hi> was actually pardoned on the condition performed of his habituall faith and repentance, which kept the intereſt of Chriſt, moſt prevailingly in his ſoul, when he was ſo foiled by actuall wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs. Which he is driven to hold, as he ſaith, becauſe he ſuppoſeth a godly man may die in groſs ſins not particularly repented of. But then methinks, it would follow hereupon, that <hi>David</hi> after his riſing again by actuall repentance, was pardoned onely as to his ſenſe, being really and actually par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned before (even in the committing the crimes) on the condition of his habituall faith: which yet I think that <hi>Mallcus,</hi> and happy confuter of the Antinomians, will not grant.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Some diſtinguiſh of <hi>habituall</hi> and <hi>actuall pardon,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their <hi>habituall</hi> and <hi>actuall faith and repentance.</hi> And ſo <hi>David</hi> ſhould have the former before he was recovered by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, not the later. But this diſtinction may not be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, becauſe though there be habits of <hi>ſanctifying grace inſuſed into,</hi> and inherent in us, diſtinguiſhed from the actuall exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe thereof, yet <hi>grace justifying</hi> and pardoning, is wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, and is Gods act; and therefore I ſee not how any can be ſaid to have habitual pardon.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall now caſt in my Mite for explicating this matter, by propounding, explaining, and applying theſe two diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Diſtinguiſh betwixt <hi>virtuall pardon,</hi> and <hi>the formall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of pardon.</hi> The terms of the diſtinction (after I had in my thoughts pitched on them) I found in <hi>Ames, Medul. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 27. though he explain them in a ſenſe different from what I intend to ſignifie thereby. <hi>Per formalem applicationem</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>remittuntur peccata praeterita, ſutura autem virtua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilter. Praeterita in ſe, futura in ſubjecto vel perſonâ peccante.</hi> The fore-praiſed Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> alſo, in his <hi>Method for ſetling Peace of Conſcience, p.</hi> 266. ſpeaks of <hi>virtuall justification,</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:170420:61"/>which <hi>David</hi> did not loſe, and <hi>actual,</hi> which he did at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent loſe by his ſin. And of (which comes to the ſame effect) <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>more prefect juſtification.</hi> But I mean by <hi>virtuall pardon,</hi> and the <hi>formal application of pardon,</hi> an <hi>actual and potential pardon,</hi> not onely <hi>in potentiâ remotâ,</hi> but <hi>proxima.</hi> As the fruit is virtually contained in the ſeed: ſo where there is a ſeed of habituall faith, there is a principle certainly (through Gods grace promiſed) productive of actual particular repentance for particular groſs ſins, in due time. The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven (true grace) is thus compared to a grain of Muſtard ſeed.</p>
                  <p>The virtuall or potentiall pardon is acquitting from ſin on ſuch a condition, which is inchoatly in the ſinner, <hi>viz.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſeed of it, certainly productive of actuall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar repentance for thoſe groſs ſins: not onely as what ſhall be in reſpect of Gods Decree (which hath no condition) to which <hi>Ames</hi> ſeems to referre, (if there were ſuch a pardon or juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in reſpect of Gods decree to pardon, a man might be ſaid to be juſtified before he is born) but eſpecially, in that, there is that habituall faith and repentance in the ſinner, which will certainly produce actuall before death. And thus <hi>David</hi> was virtually or potentially inchoatly pardoned, as to thoſe groſs ſins not yet particularly and actually repented of; and ſo he was not out of the ſtate of juſtification then (as out Divines expreſs it.) But yet he was not formally pardoned, till upon actuall repentance he had attained actuall recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, eſpecially in reference to thoſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſins, whereby he was diſobliged from Gods wrath due to him for the ſame. For this forgiveneſſe is not to be expected but upon actuall repentance, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7, 9. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. And if it were otherwiſe, a godly man could not preſume.</p>

               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>§. 6.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. Diſtinguiſh the way <hi>God hath confined us to, wherein on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may expect pardon, from the way God out of his Royall prerogative may take for pardoning a ſinner.</hi> The way preſcribed in the word, wherein onely we may expect pardon through Chriſt, is in performance of the Goſpel-condition of actuall faith and repentance, for all ſins in general, for more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar groſs ſins particularly; and in the continuance hereof Now God ties us, not himſelfe: If any of the elect ſhould die before actuall particular repentance, they having not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170420:62"/>for ſuch repentance, as in the caſe of ſelf-murder up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a violent temptation, or the like, God may acquit them from the guilt of that particular ſin upon their habituall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for it. But this we cannot expect, nor build upon, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no Rule for it, that God will do ſo, though we cannot ſay he never will. Beſides, we know not what actuall repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance God may give to ſuch in the inſtant before death, ſuch ſecret things belong not to us. And therefore as we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not judge others, as to this, ſo neither may we vary from the Rule of actuall faith and repentance, in order to our expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the obtaining and continuance of pardon and juſtification unto life and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>The Reader will (perhaps) ſay, To what purpoſe hath this perplexed queſtion about the ſtate of a Chriſtian, under ſome notorious ſins, been here ſpoken of? I anſwer. Becauſe it is, as I ſuppoſe, much conducing to the clearing of the caution we have in hand, that it is not the viſibility or probable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of habitual faith primarily that is requited, which ſhould authorize the Church or Miniſters to admit a perſon to the Sacraments, but a viſible actuall faith ſhewed (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) in a preſent conformity and obedience to the Goſpel. For ſince habitual faith &amp; repentance cannot (according to the rule we muſt expect to be ordered by) entitle a perſon to actuall pardon, or the formal application of pardon; it followes that that habitual faith isnot enquired for primarily, in order to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Sacraments, which are inſtituted to ſeal actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remiſſion of ſin, and are ſo deſigned by the miniſtrators thereof. It is true, where we require actuall faith, habituall is ſuppoſed: but habituall is not ſufficient, though we could be aſſured thereof, being not ſufficient (in its kind as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) for the obtaining of pardon of ſins. And this leads us to the ſecond Caution, which is this.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>§. 7.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. That a perſon is not judged by the Church, or Miniſter, to be deſtitute of grace, no not viſibly and <hi>apparenter,</hi> neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily upon the account of their debarring him from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but onely that he doth not live in the viſible actuall exerciſe of faith, but walketh in wayes inconſiſtent therewith: And which therefore bring him under guilt at preſent; ſo that his ſins are retained <hi>in heaven,</hi> that is, unpardoned as well as <hi>on earth</hi> in the Church. As by the preaching of the word they are retained <hi>in ſoro interno,</hi> or <hi>poenitentiali;</hi> ſo by the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170420:62"/>in <hi>foro externo &amp; juridicali, Matth.</hi> 16.19. &amp; 18.18. As in preaching (I ſay) the threatnings or comforts, mens conditions are manifeſted to their own conſciences; ſo in Church-cenſures inflicted on offenders, and in Eccleſiaſticall reſtoring of them, there is a ſolemn application of the threats or promiſes of comforts to particular perſons, upon credible evidence of their ſtates, being ſuch as may require the ſame reſpectively, either the one or the other. Now a godly man may have need of having the threatnings applied to him, ſuppoſing his fall into any groſs ſin not particularly repented of. And ſo may have his ſins retained by the Church, not onely he who hath the habit of ſaving faith inwardly (and undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably, as to others;) but alſo he of whoſe habituall juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying or ſincere faith, the Church or Miniſters have probable hopes at that very time. As ſuppoſe in <hi>Davids</hi> caſe, one who had long known his former upright life, might by that have had more probable grounds whereupon to judge and eſteem him habitually holy, then from his preſent crimes to judge or eſteem him deſtitute of true holineſs. The like is the caſe of ſome few of the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and ſuch notorious heretickes in our dayes, who upon the account of their former holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation a long time, are hoped to have a ſeed of grace in them, which will in due time (through Gods mercy) exert it ſelfe, for their converſion from their preſent blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies (as it hath done in ſome.) Yet what ſober perſon can doubt that at preſent they are in ſuch wayes of actuall infidelity and wickedneſs, as to be rejected (as they are) by our Churches.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="8" type="section">
                  <head>§. 8.</head>
                  <p>The third Caution that muſt be here remembred, which was hinted before, <hi>viz.</hi> That it belongs primarily to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Church to judge what perſons are ſo unbelievers, in reſpect of their notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel, as that the Lords Supper may not be adminiſtred to them; this being confeſſed by all to be one inſtance of Eccleſiaſtical puniſhment, or rather caſtigation; <hi>viz.</hi> in excluſion from the Sacrament. And then (where the Church is in ſuch a capacity to judge) I humbly conceive the Miniſter (while he is their Miniſter) is to adminiſter according to their judgement, yea although their publick judgement thwart his own opinion. For in ſuch a caſe the queſtion is not, whether unbelievers by notorious diſobedience to the Goſpel, ſhould be admitted; that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170420:63"/>recede from to gratifie any: but whether this or that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ſuch an unbleliever, which is regularly in a Church under Eccleſiaſticall government to be determined by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick judgement, wherein particular perſons are (and an Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer conſidered as a ſingle perſon is) concluded, ſo as it may not be reſiſted by him alone, (though he hath the liberty of appeal as opportunity is offered.) As when a Judge acquits one upon the verdict of the Jury whom he thinkes ought not to be acquitted. The queſtion there is not, whether the guilty ſhould be acquitted, that may not be done by him upon any terms, but whether that perſon is guilty; and here without any injuſtice he ſubmits his own opinion to the publick judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them whom the Law makes Judges (in ſome ſort) of the fact in ſuch caſes. I ſaid while the Miniſter continueth to be their Miniſter, he is obliged thus to comply; but in ſome groſs and palpable male-adminiſtrations, it is thought the Miniſter (and ſo the Judge in the former inſtance) ſhould leave his place, rather then continue to execute the wicked determinations of the publick judgement aforeſaid; As <hi>Hooker</hi> in the Preface to his Eccleſiaſticall Polity ſayes, <hi>Calvin</hi> did in ſuch a caſe; preaching his farewell Sermon upon ſuch a wrong judgement paſſed by the Conſiſtory of <hi>Geneva</hi> for the admiſſion of a notorious offender to the Sacrament.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="9" type="section">
                  <head>§. 9.</head>
                  <p n="4">4. But when the Church is not in that capacity, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not a governing Church, nor can be procured, I ſuppoſe it is devolved to the diſeretion and prudence of the Miniſter for ſuſpending his own act of delivering the Sacrament to ſuch as are openly wicked and profane, and (as it were) <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate. For the proving hereof, or what is tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamount, that reverend Divine Mr. <hi>Blake</hi> hath given us his ren reaſons in his <hi>Covenant ſealed, ch.</hi> 7. §. 16. well worthy of conſideration, and anſwered objections made by Mr. <hi>Jeanes</hi> againſt the ſame. To which, (if it would not be counted too much preſumption) I would add. There is no one (I think) doubts, but a Miniſter, if caſt among heathens, to whom he preacheth the Goſpel, and they tender themſelves to baptiſin, might make uſe of his prudence and judgement of diſcretion to direct him in adminiſtring or not adminiſtring baptiſm to thoſe he diſcerns capable or incapable, who are fit Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, and who not; who ſeem to profeſſe the Chriſtian faith ſeriouſly, and who ſaying the ſame words, do yet manifeſtly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170420:63"/>ſcorn what in words they profeſs. And where he hath no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Church, to whoſe publick judgment he ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; I ſee not but the caſe as to this, is of the ſame exigence: either he is to adminiſter to all that come, or he muſt diſcern and judge who are to be refuſed and who embraced. Now there is no publick judgement for him to be guided by. But none (ſure) will ſay the former. The Miniſter is greatly concerned to do his endeavour in keeping the manifeſtly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable from participating even where there is a governing Church, much more where there is not, and ſo agreater bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is caſt upon him. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his 54. Epiſtle <hi>Cornelio fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tri,</hi> after adviſing him to admit the penitent to the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſaith, <q>

I would by way of caution note, that though the Rule for non-admiſſion or ſuſpenſion before aſſerted may not be infringed; yet there ought to be much charitable candor, renderneſſe, and wiſdome in the application of it to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall not take upon me to give particular Directions in this matter, what crimes may now denominate one ſcandalouſly prophane, that is, in wayes of wickedneſs and unbeliefe, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent viſibly, with any exerciſe of ſaving faith. Only in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall I ſhall ſay, It is my opinion. 1. That ſuch miſcarriages as are not more hainous and ſcandalous, than thoſe are which are generally acknowledged to be incident to the godly, (I mean to them who walk godly) will not be marks to us of any particular perſons unbeliefe in the ſenſe aforeſaid. I will not be particular here in making compariſons betwixt neglect of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menition, and neglect of ordinary family duty, betwixt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting cenſoriouſneſs, and ſome vaine words, containing in them an unneceſſary atteſtation, by faith, truth, and the like.
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170420:64"/>But the judicious Reader may (if he pleaſe eaſily) bethinke himſelfe of many ſuch Inſtances to be compared. 2. Thoſe crimes which are viſibly inconſiſtent with the exerciſe of faith at ſometimes, may not be ſo at other times; as <hi>polygamy</hi> in the old Teſtament, compared with the New Teſtament times. 3. The like variation may be rationall in reſpect of perſons, conſidering the difference betwixt one and another, in reſpect of temptations, helps, warnings, convictions, company, and the like. 4. Where a multitude are enwrapped in ſome crime, commonly the Ringleaders are much more deeply guilty than the reſt, drawn in by the company, example, perſwaſions of their leader.</p>

Fundamentalls are very few and plaine. And I hope upon good encouragement in ſundry Pariſhes in my neighbourhood, we ſhall not have one debarrable upon the account of ignorance, as indeed I thinke there are few, very few (comparatively) already, through Gods bleſſing upon our endeavours for private and perſonal inſtruction; which oh that all Miniſters would ſet upon! We finde great encouragement, even among thoſe aged people we ſuſpected would have been moſt averſe. They generally thanke us, when we come to their houſes, or elſwhere conferre with them.

                  <p>Upon the whole matter I conclude that there are few (com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively) in the Pariſhes I am acquainted with, who may
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:170420:65"/>lawfully be judged by us, to be in ſuch wayes of wickedneſs, as are inconſiſtent with the exerciſe of godlineſs; either becauſe (through Gods mercy) ſuch wickedneſſes do not notoriouſly appeare, (and <hi>de occultis non judicat eccleſia</hi>) or becauſe, upon their being admoniſhed thereof, they are ready to condemn themſelves, and profeſſing repentance to promiſe reformation. The maine obſtacle lying in this is that ſome notoriouſly guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of wickedneſs publiquely known (through the nature of the crime it ſelfe they have committed) are unwilling to profeſs publiquely their repentance for the ſame. And yet in my expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience this doth rarely happen. And I humbly conceive, that learned Gentleman M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Maurice,</hi> hath done an acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Church of God, in oppoſing the practices of ſome Miniſters in his neighbourhood, who aſſociated with ſome few of their members in one Church, to adminiſter the Sacrament there; neglecting it wholly in their own proper Churches. Its better to be too charitable (if I may ſo ſpeake) in judging them capable who are not, then too cenſorious in judging them not capable who are ſo. Better it were that ſome have what belongs not to them, than any ſhould be deprived of their due. I conjecture by the places I know, that there are few places in <hi>England,</hi> where a Miniſter can ſufficiently excuſe himſelf in neglect of adminiſtring the Sacrament to his charge; by the pretence of want of a competent number of viſibly ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Communicants. And that the want of Elders is no plea ſufficient, hath been proved by many pens, which I heartily aſſent unto; and therefore would earneſtly deſire Miniſters not to neglect the celebration of the Sacrament in their owne places, upon ſuch pretences, although in ſuch want of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment a greater burthen muſt needs lye upon their own ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. In ſhort, <hi>I would be as charitable as might be in judging and diſcerning who are in wayes of wickedneſs, viſibly inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with any exerciſe of faith,</hi> (And yet to prevent abuſe of this doctrine, it muſt be remembred, that we are to judge our ſelves by a ſtricter Rule in diſcerning of our conditions, than others may make uſe of in probable diſcerning concerning us.

                  <p>Then for the thing it ſelfe. Firſt, he deſcribes <hi>poſitively be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, ſuch who are ſoederally and profeſſedly of the Chriſtian perſwaſion.</hi> Well, and are not all the excommunicate, or moſt of them ſo? have not they a dogmatical faith? And 2. are they not foederally, poſitively engaged; no time nor condition can take off, or free them from their baptiſmal engagements.</p>
                  <p>Well, but in his explanation of his <hi>unbeleevers negatively,</hi> he addes more to the deſcription of his <hi>poſitively beleevers;</hi> as namely; 1. Viſible ſubmiſſion to the outward meanes of faith and reformation, not as aliens but of the houſhold of faith. 2. Not juſtifying their miſcarriages. 3. But coming to our ſolemnities. 4. Profeſſedly hoping in Chriſt for ſalvation; and 5. in no other Saviour. And <hi>p.</hi> 57. he further deſcribes them thus. <hi>The baptized among us that frequent our Aſſemblies, heare our doctrine with reverence and attention, joyne with us in our ſolemnities, give us viſible teſtimony of their aſſent to our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, to ſuch we are to adminiſter as beleevers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now 1. I would know what Reaſon Mr. <hi>W.</hi> can produce for
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170420:67"/>putting in theſe qualifications, into the deſcription of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively beleever, rather than, that he ſhould in generall, walk according to his profeſſion, which makes a viſible Saint, or juſtified beleever? 2. If all theſe be neceſſary to make up his poſitive beleever, who muſt have the Sacrament then, if theſe or any of theſe be wanting viſibly, in a baptized perſon adult, and not excommunicate, he is not (or not enough) a poſitive beleever, and ſo muſt not be admitted to the Sacrament. It ſhould ſeeme then, its Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his doctrine, that if a perſon bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and adult, either will not be reproved, is a deſperate ſwearer, who as the dog turns againe to rent him, that (though never ſo prudently and meekly) caſts the pearles of admonition before him; or if he frequent not (come not above twice or thrice a yeare to any publique, religious ſolemnities) or if he do juſtifie and plead for his miſcarriages; or if he know not whether Chriſt be God or no, whom he ſaith he hopes in; or whether Chriſt be man too and dyed; yea or if he do not <hi>heare the word with reverence and attention,</hi> and give us viſible teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his aſſent thereunto. In any of theſe caſes (much more where all concurre) ſuſpenſion is allowed of; and I preſume Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would not have this perſon for any one of theſe offences excommunicated in his ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> excluded all publique Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. And yet whiles he grants all this, he pretends to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie the poſition I oppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that no ignorant or ſcandalous baptized adult, and not excommunicated perſon ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bared the Sacrament; our Gentleman who is ſo impatient of being contradicted by me, can calmly and contentedly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelfe, and that in ſo many inſtances altogether.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I would demand, where God hath promiſed to him that beleeves dogmatically only, and profeſſeth ſo, and that he is willing to receive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that he ſhall have the Sacrament, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the bare ſignes, or the thing ſignified thereby? If he will forbeare to anſwer theſe ſcriblings (as his ſeverity calls my writings) till he have ſome cleere proofe for that, I thinke we ſhall be no more honoured with his publique aſſaults. But I may not impoſe ſuch hard conditions on him; his tongue and pen are his own.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But if his poſitive beleever do truly profeſs the whole Chriſtian perſwaſion, that is, to aſſent to the doctrine of the Goſpel underſtandingly (for a man cannot be perſwaded of what he underſtands not) and that he hopes in Chriſt, that is, in Chriſts way; he is a juſtified beleever. If he do but credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170420:67"/>profeſs the ſame, no one doubts of his admiſſion to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But then the Queſtion will be, whether this word profeſſion is credible, when his deeds do notoriouſly contradict the ſame; of which we muſt ſpeake beneath.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> addes, <hi>p.</hi> 51. And <hi>we read not of any debarring this had people</hi> (the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) <hi>from the ſolemnity of the Paſſeover. There were no ſuch imperious Maſters of Reformation in thoſe dayes, which gathered proſelytes of the better ſort into a faction, and excluded all the rest from Church fellowſhip, as the world, aliens, unbeleevers, and no Church members.</hi>—Likewiſe the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are Jewes by nature, and not ſinners of the Gentiles; ſo our people are Chriſtians by nature and birth, and not ſinners of the Pagans, poſitively by the proper Rules of their very profeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This latter aſſertion of our being Chriſtians by birth, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> were Church members borne I deny not. But thats no <hi>medium</hi> to prove the general admiſſion he pleads for. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer words of his are argumentative after a faſhion. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is gathered from comparing the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, with the Paſſeover among the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with the Jewiſh Governours then.</p>
                  <p>And here firſt we have the flowers of his argument, <hi>Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maſters of Reformation; faction.</hi> He ſhould remember he was to diſpute not revile now. But ſome mens mouthes do ſo abound with the diſtillation of reproachfull termes, that they can hardly <hi>ſpeake vehemently, without ſpitting abuſively.</hi> 2. We have his falſe intimations, that <hi>we gather proſelytes into a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, excluding all the rest,</hi> &amp;c. This falſhood runs almoſt through his book; that we gather new Churches, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime the old conſtitution as null, lay another in examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: notorious untruths! I ſhall ſay no more to them now, but demand, whether the <hi>Conſtitutions and Cannons eccleſiaſticall, primo Jacobi,</hi> which Can. 27. enjoyned that all ſhould kneel at the Communion, and that the Miniſter ſhould not deliver it to any if they did not kneele; were intended by the Impoſers thereof (or did it amount in the nature of the thing it ſelfe) to a new conſtitution of the Church? Did they gather the kneelers into a faction as their proſelytes. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> I thinke, will hereby croſs his affection to the Prelatical Government, hinted in his <hi>p.</hi> 73.) ſo as to ſay that was a factious deſigne. And then all excluding ſome-from the Communion in our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170420:68"/>Churches (without excommunicating them from all Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances) yea though upon unſcriptural grounds (for I am of opinion, their kneeling was not <hi>jure divino,</hi> no more than bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the name of Jeſus) is not a demoliſhing of the former conſtitution of the Church, and erecting a new one in a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And I might ask, whether every time the people of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> were by their godly Magiſtrates called to renew their Covenant with God, and ſometimes ſo ſtrictly enjoyned here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, that he that refuſed ſhould be ſeverely puniſhed, yea ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Congregation. (2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.9, 12, 13. <hi>&amp;</hi> 34.29, 31, 32. <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.3, 5, 7, 8.11, 12.19.) Whether (I ſay) then they pulled down the old conſtitution of their Church, and made a new one in a faction?</p>
                  <p>But I keepe the Reader too long from the argument, the ſtrength whereof I ſhall neither conceal nor decline, though its but ſorrily here hinted by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> And becauſe this objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt ſuſpenſion is the ſtrongeſt that I know of, I ſhall take the occaſion here offered to ſpeake more cloſely, and yet largely unto it. But of this in the two following Chapters. Now to our Crums of comfort.</p>

                  <p>THe paſſage wherein Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is pleaſed to inſinuate the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt ſuſpenſion, is this; <hi>We read not of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring this bad people</hi> (the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) <hi>from the ſolemnity of the Paſſeover.</hi> The argument here intimated is this; All the people circumciſed, though never ſo bad, were admitted to the Paſſeover, therefore ſo muſt all the baptized adult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I deny the conſequence as its here propounded, (and yet it is moſt ſtrictly propounded, according to the fore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed paſſage of our Friend, from which its framed) becauſe it proceeds from <hi>fact</hi> to <hi>right,</hi> which is not valid; if it were, he might by like reaſon prove polygamy lawfull, becauſe it was in ſo many ages, and by the beſt ſort of men in thoſe ages practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And if in ſtead of [admitted] we put [rightfully ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted] to the Paſſeover: yet the conſequence is not cleere enough to determine our controverſie. Becauſe the Ordinances of the Old Teſtament are not without limitations, Rules for the New, in theſe things. We grant an argument may be drawn from Analogy in ſome caſes, <hi>viz.</hi> where we can prove the Analogy it ſelfe by Scripture, or at leaſt that the ground of the Analogy is of equall concernment and latitude to us now, as to them in the old Teſtament, and that too not retrenched by any particular Inſtitution in the New.</p>

                  <p>The ſtrength of that Argument from infant-circumciſion for pedobaptiſm, lies not in this immediately, that becauſe their children were circumciſed ours muſt be baptized; but becauſe it's evident by their circumciſion, that they were Church-members: therefore our children are Church-members. Which conſequence holds firmly, unleſſe it could be ſhewed, either that their Church-memberſhip was typicall, and ſo concerns not us, or elſe that that priviledge of Church-memberſhip belonging to the children of the believing Jewes then, is now reverſed in the New Teſtament, which we put the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts or Antipedobaptiſts to prove if they can. And then becauſe they (or moſt of them) grant, that <hi>all Church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> (not forfeiting their priviledges as infan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170420:69"/>baptized,</hi> hence we conclude Infant-baptiſm. But now in this Argument from the Paſſeover to the Lords Supper, (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing at preſent but not granting the rightfull generall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mſſion there pretended) there is not the like ground of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to go upon. For we grant not to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> that all Church-members (whereof many forfeit their priviledges) may be admitted to the Lords Supper. This is the thing in queſtion between us. If he would have argued to purpoſe, he ſhould have given in his <hi>Medium,</hi> whereby he would evince the like generality of the ſubjects recipient of the Lords Supper as of the Paſſeover. Whether from the identity of nature, uſe, and ſignification of the Paſſeover and the Lords Supper, or from what elſe, and then it would be conſidered.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. Again, concerning the thing ſignified in the Paſſeover, we may conſider, In the firſt celebration of it, according to the inſtitution, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.17, 27. &amp; 34.18. <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.1. Two things are repreſented therin as it was a token, 1. of Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull <hi>paſsing over</hi> their houſes, when the firſt born of the Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians were ſlain in each of their houſes. 2. Their <hi>paſsing out</hi> of Aegypt. Some ſpeak of another <hi>Tranſitus</hi> denoted, <hi>viz,</hi> their <hi>paſſage through</hi> the red Sea. But I find no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-ground for this in particular; onely as it was a part of their bringing out of Egypt, it was not excluded; yet not ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally referred to, as the two former were; &amp; yet of theſe one (the later) ſeems to be more intended then the other (the former.) My reaſon is, becauſe there was another ordinance inſtituted particularly, referring to this, <hi>viz.</hi> the giving up the firſt born to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2, 13, 15. So there was not of that. No doubt too the Paſſeover was a type of Chriſt, (as the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170420:70"/>Manna and water of the Rock were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3, 4.) by the right uſe wherof the godly were to be led to the meditation of the Meſſias to be reſted on. But as the Manna &amp; Water were communicated to them who were not capable of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a Sacrament as ſuch, ſo might the Paſſeover alſo. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were other ends and reaſons of it, beſides what were ſacramentall. And then our Sacrament of the Lords Supper is not to be parallel'd with them in this generall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; where the receiving the Bread and Wine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is meerly ſacramentall (not at all intended as a Meale for the body as thoſe were) referring onely to Chriſt, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by him; not as theirs which was a commemoration of a temporall deliverance, which wicked men had a ſhare in, as wel (and as to the deliverance conſidered in it ſelf as much) as the beſt had.

Furthermore, if we have clear grounds in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament to deny the generall admiſſion (pleaded for) to the Lords Supper, whatſoever is urged from the old Teſtament, will have no conſequence in it to the New.

                  <p>It is certainly a moſt hard thing to give any conſiſtent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count about many concernments of the Paſſeover, How all the Paſchal Lambs ſhould be kild (in the place where the Lord ſhould chooſe) <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.5, 6. and the blood of each ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on one Altar: And as ſome ſay, the fat ſacrificed on the Altar too. How all theſe (many hundreds) could be ſo kild in one place, in one evening (or betwixt the two evenings, as they called it) in a few hours ſpace, is a thing to me hugely difficult to conceive. And whether <hi>Capellus</hi> his diſtinction of a <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick immolation</hi> of the Paſſeover, doth avail here, I dare not determine. How difficult is it to ſhew how the Jewes might certainly know the Even of the fourteenth day (which ſome accounted to be the beginning of the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth) after the Moon had changed; eſpecially when the change of the Moon happened to be neer the end of one day, and beginning of another? And from this uncertainty moſt probably came the variation of dayes, wherein Chriſt and the Jewes celebrated his laſt Paſſeover; if there were ſuch a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which is (as I remember) denied by <hi>Tolet</hi> and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> whom <hi>Cloppenburgius</hi> defends; but aſſerted by the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Cauſabon.</hi> The Arguments of both parties are marſhalled by <hi>Capellus</hi> in his <hi>

                  <p>Divers other difficulties there are about the Paſſeover, which with the former mentioned, may confirm what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſo reaſonably aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is utterly unfit to reduce ſo many clear Goſpel-Arguments to one dark one from thoſe Ordinances about the Paſſeover, if there were ſuch an one. I ſhall add alſo, That there is no ſmall dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in clearing who were the ſubjects to be partakers of the Paſſeover, particularly whether children ſo ſoon as they were capable of eating fleſh, did not partake? I ſhall not diſcuſs the point, it would be too long; onely I muſt crave liberty to ſay, that I ſee no convincing-proofs of their excluſion, nor any abſurdity following upon their reception; whiles I conſider the Paſſeover (as was before hinted) was not wholly and onely ſacramentall; though I believe it was a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as the Manna was alſo to ſome:) and the Scripture probabilities of their partaking, are more then I can finde alledged for the contrary. And if this Argument be further urged for admiſſion of all ſuch to the Lords Table, as were admitted, (or are ſuppoſed by ſome to have been admitted) to the Paſſeover. It may be it will occaſion a further and more exact conſideration of that point, concerning their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants partaking of the Paſſeover: Which. yet if aſſerted, will not (I think) inferre; that ſuch children now muſt partake of the Lords Supper: But will moſt effectually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the conſequence of the argument I am now anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould now proceed to a ſecond anſwer to be given to this argument; which I ſhall forthwith endeavour as ſoon as I have taken my Cordiall following.</p>

                  <p>THe laſt Chapter preſented what I judged ſufficient (at preſent) to anſwer to the conſequence of this argument, <hi>viz. If all the people of the Jewes circumciſed, though never ſo bad, were admitted to the Paſſeover, then all ſuch baptized, muſt now be admitted to the Lords Supper.</hi> The Antecedent aſſumed is: <hi>But all the people (circumciſed) were admitted to the Paſſeover.</hi> Concerning which this Chapter will give an account of my apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>generall admiſſion</hi> (much more this rightfull generall admiſſion) to the Paſſeover, here aſſerted, is denyed not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out many reaſons given of the deniall of it by the learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall alſo humbly offer ſomewhat in the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, whereby the foreſaid aſſumption may be diſproved. I ſhall meet with and ſolve the moſt colourable pretenſions that (I have ſeen) undertaking its protection.</p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:170420:72"/>
                  <p n="1">(1) The command of celebrating the Paſſeover is delivered in general termes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.3, 6, 43, 44, 45, 47. &amp;c. <hi>All the Cngregation of Iſrael ſhall keep it.</hi> And this reacheth cleerely thus far; that they all there ſpoken of were obliged to this <hi>as their duty,</hi> viz. to celebrate the Paſſeover according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of it. But hence it follows not, that there might be no hindrances (and that through their own fault,) which might debar them <hi>in ſtatu quo</hi> from doing what they were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged unto. The obligation to a duty doth not ever warrant the performing of it, when theres a preſent incapacity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs for it; but it ſhould put on ever and provoke to a preparation and performance both.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I ſhould thinke all Chriſtian adult profeſſors bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, are obliged to celebrate the Lords Supper, yea even the moſt prophane, (ſhall I adde, the juſtly excommunicate alſo who are not diſobliged from, though debar'd from the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment through their own default). A drunken profeſſor of Chriſtianity, whiles drunk at the time of divine ſervice, is not ſure diſobliged from Gods publique ſervice, no not from the Lords Supper, but yet, none doubts, he is then juſtly debarr'd and excluded from the ſame. There are two ſorts of hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances from the Sacrament. 1. When the perſons hindred are wilfully acceſſory to their own hindrance. 2. When they are hindred without their own fault. The firſt hinders but doth not excuſe; the latter both hinders and excuſeth: of the former ſort we had an inſtance in the man who neglected to circumciſe his males, in which default, he was debarred, yet not excuſed from celebrating the Paſſeover, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48. Of the latter ſort ſeeme thoſe mentioned, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. in caſe of ceremonial uncleaneneſs. And yet if any did unneceſſarily and wilfully touch a dead body, or take a journey fifteene miles from the camp, or from <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> (as the <hi>Jewes</hi> interpret [a farr off] though they were hereby hindred, they were not excuſed before God for their neglect.)</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) But in reference to theſe perſons hindred from the Paſſeover, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. I ſhall obſerve theſe things.</p>

That there was no expreſs exception of them in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer generall commands, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. <hi>That all Iſrael ſhould doe the Paſſeover.</hi> For then there could have been no doubt about theſe in their caſe; at leaſt <hi>Moſes</hi> would not have been at a ſtand about it, as he ſeemes to be, <hi>verſ.</hi> 8.2.

That there was then an order, and care had, for keeping back ſome (even of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) from the Paſſeover. Theſe two laſt obſervations are evident in <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7. Thoſe defiled ſay to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron, Wherefore are we kept backe; that we may not offer—among the children of Iſrael?</hi> Which implyes that they tendred themſelves to partake, and complained that they were by ſome kept back. 4. That its manifeſt here is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended an enumeration of all impediments, no not of all thoſe impediments which excuſed from doing the Paſſeover, (as ſickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not here mentioned) <hi>how much leſs of thoſe which excuſed not; which I thinke this text doth not refer to.</hi> And therefore notwithſtanding this place, the <hi>Jewes</hi> thought other things barrs of their celebrating the Paſſeover. <hi>John</hi> 18.20. <hi>They went not themſelves into the Judgement hall, leaſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might keep the Paſſeover.</hi> They judged preparation for the Paſſeover (for which they had a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne day) antecedently neceſſary to the doing of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. And probably, in their judgement, a litigious action on an holy day, was accounted a moral ſin, which they pretended to make ſcruple of. There is little doubt, they hold excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication for moral ſins, as Mr. <hi>Gelaſpy</hi> hath copiouſly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And yet neither are their excommunicates expreſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in this text; ſo that it ſhould make againſt their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the <hi>de facto,</hi> as well as the <hi>ipſo jure excommunicate.</hi> It cannot therefore be inferred from this text, that all did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Paſſeover, except thoſe in a journey, or polluted by a dead body.</p>

                  <p n="3">(3) It may further be conſidered, that there were thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere lawes againſt ſin, as required the <hi>cutting off</hi> ſuch as were notorious and ſcandalous offenders. I confeſſe its a mighty dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult thing cleerly to determine the importance of that phraſe; Its applyed ſo variouſly; ſometimes as a puniſhment for ſmall offences, the neglecting ſome ceremony, or the like. <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.38. <hi>Levit.</hi> 7.18, 20, 21, 26, 27. <hi>Numb.</hi> 19.13, 20.

Divers texts, particularly, the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſeeme to evince that it was <hi>putting one to death,</hi> which <hi>cutting off</hi> imported.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:170420:73"/>might be private, and not juridically or otherwiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly known; and therefore could not be puniſhed by man, with the cutting off by death. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſaith on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.14. <q>
                        <hi>It is ſometimes ſpoken of Gods cutting off men by death for their ſins.</hi> Levit. 17.10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 20.3, 5, 6. <hi>And ſo the Hebrewes underſtand it here, and in all other like places, that for wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tranſgreſſion in ſecret God would cut them off by untimely death.</hi>
                     </q> (Which may be thus expounded, that the offender might expect Gods immediate vengeance in ſuch caſes, though the Lord had not (by his threatnings) tyed up himſelfe from exerciſing patience and long-ſuffering towards them.) <q>
                        <hi>And if there be witneſſes of it, the Magiſtrate is to puniſh or kill them. But for ignorant tranſgreſſions, they were to bring the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſacrifices;</hi>

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170420:73"/>was celebrated, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 5.10. immediatly after the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the adult, not circumciſed in the Wilderneſſe before; which its no way probable they were compelled to receive, without being acquainted with, and having reſpect to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they entred with God, and God with them, whereof circumciſion was a ſeale. And that the people (indefinitely) were then in a viſible beleeeving frame and obediential po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, is gatherable from <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18. which the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous bringing them through <hi>Jordan</hi> alſo, (immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this their celebration of the Paſſeover) was apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme and eſtabliſh them in, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>During the time of the <hi>Judges</hi> we read of no Paſſeover kept (I do not ſay there was none). And in the time of the <hi>Kings</hi> there are but two Paſſeovers recorded in holy Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> one during the reigne of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and the other of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> thoſe two good Kings. <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> we have 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. where is mentioned (according to our tranſlation) the long inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of it, <hi>v.</hi> 6. <hi>That they had not done it of a long time, in ſuch ſort as it was written.</hi> (In ſtead whereof both the Syriack and Arabick verſions have, <hi>Becauſe their riches were much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed</hi>). And there are here, not only no intimations of the viſible prophaneneſſe of any who did partake, but great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is given to the contrary. They were indefinitly called by the King and Princes to <hi>turne againe to the Lord, and that they ſhould not be ſtiffaecked,</hi> v. 6, 7. and they anſwered that call, <hi>v.</hi> 11. Of ſome its ſaid, that <hi>they humbled themſelves,</hi> (they <hi>were confounded,</hi> ſaith the <hi>LXX, acquieſcentes conſilio,</hi> ſaith the vulgar Latine: they <hi>were contrite in heart,</hi> ſaith the Syriack, or <hi>they trembled in heart,</hi> as the Arabick) <hi>and they came to Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem.</hi> And of others its ſaid, v. 12. <hi>God gave them one heart to do the commandment of the King and Princes by the word of the Lord;</hi> which was to <hi>turne to the Lord,</hi> as before. And that this was manifeſted in deeds and notable inſtances of real re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is ſhewed <hi>v.</hi> 13. And then <hi>Hezekiah begged pardon,</hi> or <hi>acceptance for them</hi> (only) <hi>who had prepared their hearts to ſeek God,</hi> v. 19. Which implyes that he took them (all inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly) for ſincere beleevers. The Syriack verſion hath it thus; <hi>The good God expiate for the whole people of Iſrael, ſeeing that we have prepared our hearts to pray to God,</hi> &amp;c. And the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabick ſaith; <hi>The God of goodneſſe ſpare the Iſralitiſh nation, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he hath prepared our hearts to pray to God,</hi> &amp;c. And then <hi>v.</hi> 21. they kept the feaſt of <hi>unleavened bread with gladneſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:170420:74"/>and the whole aſſembly took counſel &amp; kept other ſeven dayes with gladneſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 23, 26.</p>

                  <p>The other Paſſeover was in the time of <hi>Joſiah,</hi> recorded 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.22, 23. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.1, 2. &amp;c. where is to be obſerved, that things being much out of order by the ill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Grand-father <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> and his Father <hi>Amon, Joſiah</hi> doth endeavour a reformation before its ſtory'd that he called the people to a Paſſeover; In the twelfth yeare of his reigne, he began to purge <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from the high places, groves, and Images, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.3, 4, 5, 6, 7. And then it followes, <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Now in the</hi> 18th <hi>yeare of his reigne, when he had purged the Land and the houſe,</hi> he took order to repaire the houſe of God: and having found the book of the Law, he cauſed it to be read to all the people, great and ſmall, <hi>v.</hi> 30. he himſelfe being greatly humbled by the contents thereof; <hi>He</hi> v. 31. <hi>made a Covenant before the Lord, to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lord, and to keep his Commandments, and teſtimonies, and ſtatutes, with all his heart and ſoul, to performe the words of the Covenant which are written in this book.</hi> And <hi>v.</hi> 32, 33. <hi>he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> all preſent in Jeruſalem and Judah</hi> (all the people, <hi>v.</hi> 30.) <hi>to ſtand to it. And the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem did according to the Covenant of God, the God of their Fathers. And Joſiah took away all the abominations out of the Countryes that pertained to the children of Iſrael; and made all that were preſent in Iſrael, to ſerve,</hi> even <hi>to ſerve the Lord their God. And all his dayes they departed not from following the Lord, the God of their Fathers.</hi> And now having thus prepared the people (in this ſame 18th yeare of his reigne, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23.23. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.19.) he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the people to keepe the Paſſeover there recorded. What footſteps are there here of any viſible prophane perſons partaking of the Paſſeover?</p>
                  <p>There is only one more example in the old Teſtament ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6. It pleaſed God after a long captivity for the humbling <hi>Judah,</hi> to ſtir up <hi>Cyrus</hi> to proclaime liberty of their returne to build the Temple, he encouraging and aſſiſting them therein. Thoſe of <hi>them whoſe ſpirit God rayſed to goe, Ezra</hi> 1.5. Cloſed with the deſigne, attempted it, and purſued it, with a viſible frame of great humility, feare of the Lord, zeale for his ſervice; and to the utmoſt layd out themſelves in the ſame. <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.68, 69. the whole third <hi>Chap. Chap.</hi> 5.5-11. (1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 5.44, 45, 53, 61, 63, 65.) <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.14,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170420:74"/>15, 16, 17, &amp;c. And then is related their keeping the Paſſeover, <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>viz.</hi> as is ſhewed, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>The children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael which were come againe out of captivity; and all ſuch as had ſeparated themſelves from the filthineſs of the heathen of the Land,</hi> to ſock the Lord God of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> did eat and kept the feaſt of unleavened bread ſeven dayes with joy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Syriack ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, hath it thus; <hi>And the Iſraelites eat it, who came up from the Babylonian Captivity</hi> (viz.) <hi>all thoſe who were ſeparated from the filthineſs of the Land.</hi> And ſo it is alſo in 1 <hi>Eſdras</hi> 7.13. making that ſeparation to be the preparative qualification of all who did partake of the Paſſeover. But if we take it as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring to the Proſelytes, it ſuppoſeth the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the Proſelytes were ſo joyned, were in like manner ſeparated from the filthineſs of the nations. Upon a ſtrict view of all theſe examples; It appeares not, that any did partake un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a viſible prophaneneſſe, inconſiſtent with viſible actual faith and obedience; but the contrary.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="6" type="section">
                  <head>§. 6.</head>
                  <p n="5">(5) Let me adde, That when the people generally did keep the Paſſeover, although ſome might be notoriouſly wicked at home, it is not eaſie to conceive how thoſe who admitted their paſchal Lambs, and offered part thereof for them, and who had the charge of the holy things, could know their particular ſcandalous ſins, ſo as thereupon to debar them. How could they know who was ceremonially uncleane by touch of a dead body, or who had not circumciſed his males, and ſo was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally uncapable in that ſtate? Yea though many thus obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous might be knowne ſo to be at home, yet it being not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to thoſe Governours, they could take no notice thereof. And yet hence it follows not, that they who thus thruſt in themſelves had a proper right to actual preſent participation of the Paſſeover; as elſwhere is ſhewed by us. But the caſe is otherwiſe now, as to the Lords Supper; when Chriſtian people are gathered into particular Churches, under the Inſpection of Guides and Officers, in a ſpecial manner appropriated and deſigned to watch over them in the Lord.</p>
                  <p>However, this ſeemes evident, that on the ſame Reaſon whereby they did gather the excluſion of thoſe <hi>otherwiſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monially uncleane,</hi> from the particular expreſſe prohibition of the <hi>uncleane by a dead body:</hi> they might alſo inferre the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full excluſion or abſtenſion of all notoriouſly prophane and breakers of Gods Covenant, from the particular expreſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170420:75"/>of him who circumciſed not his males, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.48, 49.</p>

               <div n="7" type="section">
                  <head>§. 7.</head>
                  <p n="6">(6) To conclude (at laſt) this pont. The general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for celebration of the Paſſeover, is no larger then for circumciſion: now as this ſuppoſed the Covenant to be viſibly entred into, with underſtanding, as <hi>Ainſworth</hi> ſhews on <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. So that muſt ſuppoſe their continuance in that Covenant, as neceſſary to enright them in a ſacramental partaking of the Paſſeover.</p>
                  <p>But its high time for me to crave the Readers pardon for ſo long detaining him upon, and hindering his <hi>Tranſitus</hi> from this argument of the Paſſeover. But if he thinke (as I doe) that its the ſtrongeſt objection, and that anſwering it, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervate divers others (as that fetcht from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Manna and rock,</hi> though indeed its much more eaſie to anſwer thoſe, and they have been cleerly anſwered by others, and therefore I paſs them) If my Reader (I ſay) conſider the importance of this argument, I truſt he ſhal not complaine, I have provoked his patience, or abuſed his leaſure herein. If any will needs be paſſionate, I have <hi>Davids</hi> remedy for an ill ſpirit.</p>

                  <p>THe great quarrell he hath about Examination is caſt in my way, <hi>p.</hi> 54. and often elſwhere. But though it ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles uncivilly, and as a bold intruder abſurdly preſſeth in, when we are buſie about other matters, I am reſolved it ſhall ſtay for its anſwer, till its turne come among the Digreſſions, and then I ſhall deal candidly with it.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>p.</hi> 58. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> brings in this ſyllogiſme, as if it contained my ſenſe, and were ſome part of my argument, <hi>viz. Such as by Scripture characters are to be judged and taken to be unbeleevers, are unbeleevers. But all men baptized, adult, and of the Chriſtian perſwaſion (if irregular in their converſations) are by Scripture characters to be judged and taken to be unbeleevers.</hi> Ergo, <hi>all men baptized, and adult, and of the Chriſtian perſwaſion (if irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular in their converſations) are unbeleevers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He quarreld ere while with my inſerting parentheſis in a ſyllogiſme, but if I had put in ſuch a parentheſis as he here hath in his <hi>minor</hi> and <hi>concluſion,</hi> which being taken out, the ſenſe is deſtroyed in both propoſitions; I might have well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved his cenſure, which yet I liſt not to returne upon himſelfe here. But to the matter I anſwer. Did ever any one ſay, that any irregularities in converſation, were Scripture characters whereby we might judge of perſons as unbeleevers? I aſſerted only that there are ſome ſuch as would amount thereto. What thoſe are, was not our buſineſſe to enumerate. If I ſay ſome irregular in their converſations are to be excommunicated, will it hence follow, that all irregular perſons (in any reſpect ſuch) are to be excommunicated? What coherence is here? And yet this <hi>toy</hi> ſeemes to tickle his phanſie, and he plays with it againe and againe, <hi>p.</hi> 58, 59, &amp;c. And gravely as if in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ſadneſs, thus delivers himſelfe; <hi>Some irregularities in mens lives we hold not unreconcilable with a true doctrinal perſwaſion, nor with the habit of ſaving faith neither. When ſuch irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties become notorious, publique and ſcandalous, the parties ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending are legally to be proceeded againſt. But for every private miſcarriage, a Paſtor is not to debar a man at his pleaſure, upon the verbal information of ſome few in private; but deal gently by private conference with the party informed againſt, as a Father with his child.</hi>—And then he points his tale on me in theſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170420:76"/>words; <hi>This were more Chriſtian-like than your raſh frequent and rigorous ſuſpenſions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In anſwer whereto I ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Neither the habit of ſaving faith in perſons, nor of dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical faith (as I have already ſhewed) is directly enquired after by us, in order to adminiſtring the Sacraments to them; but the viſible exerciſe thereof, which an habitually godly man may be deſtitute of for a time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Who ſaid any irregularities might debar one, except no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious publique or ſcandalous?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some notorious miſcarriages need not any tryall for the proving them to be ſuch as deſerve excommunication. But the offenders are <hi>ipſo jure</hi> excommunicate, having manifeſtly and publiquely loſt their right at preſent of actual admiſſion to ſome Church Communion. 2 <hi>Epist. John,</hi> v. 10, 11. <hi>If there come any to your houſe and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe, nor bid him God ſpeed.</hi> Where particular private Chriſtians as well as others were commanded, to deale with ſuch as excommunicate in law; whether the governing Church upon a juridical tryall had declared them to be ſuch or no. What need is there of witneſſes to prove an unmarryed woman who hath borne a childe is a <hi>fornicatreſſe,</hi> or of Judges to try and diſcerne whether this ſin (without repentance manifeſted for it) deſerve excommunication. Is not 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. a ſure Rule, unleſs pronounced by the Church-Governours, or any other?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Yet its not unlawfull to take juridical cognizance of ſuch plaine caſes. <hi>(Abundans cautela non nocet)</hi> And upon good reaſon it may be judged meet and moſt orderly where it may be.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. What meanes he by a <hi>Paſtors debarring any at their pleaſure?</hi> Is not this an odious inſinuation? Do we pretend to arbitrary Government?</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Did any ever ſay that for any private miſcarriage one might be debarred?</p>
                  <p n="7">7. What quarrel hath he againſt <hi>verbal information?</hi> Is it unſufficient on that account? or muſt it needs be written?</p>
                  <p n="8">8. May not ſome private miſcarriage, that is, ſome grievous wickedneſſe privately committed, and known to two or three only, yet perſiſted in, after the procedure mentioned <hi>Math.</hi> 18. be a cauſe of excommunication, as well as a publique offence notorious in its own nature, without all ſuch previous admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>

                     <hi>W.</hi> is pleaſed to add, <hi>By our adminiſtring to believers is meant to ſuch believers as we may have certainty that they are believers. But of mens faving faith (which lies inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in the hearts of the havers thereof) we can have but a conjecture or charitable hope, of their baptiſme, and of their true doctrinall confeſsion of ſaith, we may have certainty. And their viſible conformity to the means of faith, &amp; ſolemnities of the Chriſtian Religion, with their brethren in the publick ordinances of worſhip, is a viſible teſtimony of their owning the Christian Religion. And the outward adminiſtration to them as to viſible believers, is equally their outward right, with the ſtricteſt livers. For Miniſters are but the outward miniſtrators of the elements in the Lords Supper; the Spirit is the inward administrator of the inviſible grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereunto I return, 1. That we muſt have a certainty thoſe are believers (that is, viſibly ſuch) to whom we admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170420:77"/>I readily grant. 2. That we can have any more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a perſons dogmaticall faith, then of his juſtifying faith, I have before denied, and do ſtill; upon the grounds above mentioned. He that pretends to know who is really a dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall believer, muſt pretend to know the heart immediatly. Mens dogmatical, or doctrinal. as wel as their ſaving or juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, <hi>(which lies inviſibly in the hearts of the havers thereof) we can have but a conjecture,</hi> or charitable hope of. Yea, let me add, It is as difficult (if not more) for a Chriſtian to diſcern in himſelf, whether he hath a true dogmaticall faith. <hi>i. e.</hi> whether he doth aſſent to the truths he profeſſeth, as to know whether he conſents to the ſame, receiving them in love. And who that hath been acquainted with the troubled ſpirits of the godly, and their temptations, hath not had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thoſe dangerous doubtings about believing or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the great points of Chriſtianity, concerning Chriſt, the Scriptures, &amp;c. I know a Miniſter would give much to be conſtantly aſſured that he believes the doctrines he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth concerning thoſe common and great points of the laſt judgement, heaven and hell, and the like. Yea, do not all doubts about our juſtifying faith, recurr to the doubting about our doctrinall faith, as the ground thereof? Doth not the ſoul thus argue? Could I love God ſo little, and the World ſo much, be ſo mindleſs of Gods ſervice, ſo ſluggiſh, ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of my ſoul, if I did really believe the truth of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the immortality and pretiouſneſs of my ſoul, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the world, the danger of Gods diſpleaſure, and that now is the day of grace offered to me, the continuance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I have no aſſurance for an houre longer? If a man pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to poor beggars, that if they will but come to ſuch a Prince a few miles off, they ſhall there have great riches, &amp;c. and yet they ſit ſtill and ſtirre not, would not another ſuſpect, and may not they ſuſpect themſelves, that they believe not there is truth in the propoſition and motion made unto them? <hi>Quis enim Domino mente credit, &amp; facultate non credit? Quis Deo animam ſuam mane pat, &amp; pecuniam negat? Quis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſis coelestibus fidem commodat, &amp; non agit ut eſſe poſsit parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceps promiſſionum? Et ideo cum</hi> videamus homines haec non a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gere, cogimur non credentes palam &amp; evidenter agnoſcere. <hi>Salvian ad Eccl. Cathol. l.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>And I think the great (<hi>Phyſical</hi> if I may ſo call it) work of converſion, lies in illumination of the underſtanding,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170420:77"/>
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18, 19, 20. And the will is ſweetly moved, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the nature of ſuch a faculty (yet neceſſarily in reſpect of the event) to cloſe with ſuch through convictions. A man may profeſs a dogmaticall faith, (and ſo alſo a juſtifying faith) who hath it not. And we muſt believe his credible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion. But I think that man whoſe underſtanding is ſo farre enlightned with Goſpel-truth as a ſincere believers is, is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and juſtified believer; that predominat aſſent being inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably joyned with conſent alſo.</p>
                  <p>This conſideration I have the more inſiſted on, that it might be an anſwer to that Objection, <hi>viz.</hi> If <hi>juſtifying faith onely intitle to the Sacrament, then none may receive who want aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi> Let thoſe who hold dogmaticall faith intitles to the Sacrament, anſwer, and ſay, what he muſt do who doubts (and wants aſſurance) of his dogmaticall faith; and it will ſerve to direct him, who doubts concerning his juſtifying faith: the caſe is the ſame in both.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here inſinuates (if I underſtand him) how we muſt have a certainty of their being believers, whom we admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to, <hi>viz.</hi> by our having a <hi>certainty of their baptiſme, and their true doctrinall conſeſsion of the Faith.</hi> This will ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally put an end to the Controverſie about (that which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) Examination before admiſſion to the Sacrament. But that is not now to be inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I grant, after they have once given a certainty that they have in their own perſons made a true doctrinall confeſſion of the Faith, with profeſſed conſent thereunto, their right to the Lords Supper is not to be denied, till they do by notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſs (as before hath been declared) incurre Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall cenſure.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. I know not well what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> means by <hi>viſible confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the means of Faith,</hi> and <hi>ſolemnities of publick worſhip,</hi> which he ſaith, <hi>is a viſible teſtimony of their owning the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion.</hi> If he mean that their converſations are not notoriouſly oppoſite to the faith they have profeſſed, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre. If <hi>their coming to Church,</hi> what ever their lives be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, then I demand whether a Chriſtian may be cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for no miſdemeanour, unleſs he neglect coming to Church? And if he may, then his coming to Church is not a ſufficient teſtimony that he is ſuch a viſible believer who hath right to the Sacrament,</p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:170420:78"/>
                  <p n="6">6. That ſhould ſeem to be intended as an argument which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> adds, <hi>viz. [For Ministers are but the outward Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Elements,]</hi> and then it would be to this purpoſe, If Miniſters are but outward Miniſtrators of the Elements in the Lords Supper, then the outward adminiſtration to them who are baptized and come to Church, though notoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane in their lives, is equally their outward right, with the ſtricteſt livers. But, <hi>Ergo.</hi> I deny the conſequence, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any ſemblance of connexion in it. If the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Church do retain prophane perſons in their ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall communion, that might have ſome more probability of inferring the Miniſters duty to adminiſter to them. But what is that to our caſe?</p>
               </div>
               <div n="4" type="section">
                  <head>§. 4.</head>
                  <p n="7">7. Whereas Mr. <hi>W.</hi> further adds, <hi>therefore as long as the Church holds [men baptized and grown to years] in her out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward communion, in other ordinances, ſo long doth ſhe hold them in the outward worſhip of celebrating the Lords Supper with her members as their due and duty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, Nay rather from what was before aſſerted, whence this is inferred by Mr. <hi>W. viz. That Ministers are but Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,</hi> it follows, that they are to miniſter and officiate to them as in the Churches communion only ſo far as the Church retains them in her communion. And therefore if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning Church exclude any from the Sacrament, though not ſome other Ordinances; the Miniſter anſwerably may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiat to them in other ordinances, but not in that.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Whether the governing Church may exclude ſome from communion in the Lords Supper, who are retained in other Ordinances, I know is queſtioned; and perhaps Mr. <hi>W.</hi> may aim at ſuch a thing here. But I ſee not how his words do ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie it; I ſhall not therefore here ſtand upon it, having laid down thoſe grounds before, upon which the queſtion may be determined in the affirmative.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I adventured, more particularly than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhould have thought needfull to anſwer Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions in this thing; becauſe that in his confidence of my weakneſs, he here ſo vauntingly vapours and concludes in theſe words, <hi>p.</hi> 62. <hi>In your next let me underſtand what you can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and offer for refutation hereof, which I believe you neither will do, nor can do.</hi>

                  <p>HAving cleared and confirmed, that thoſe who are viſibly in a notorious way of wickedneſs inconſiſtent with the exerciſe of true faith, are on that account ſuch unbelievers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, as have no immediate right to the Lords Supper, and ſo ought not to have it adminiſtred unto them. The Aſſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on follows at numb. 25. in my M. S. That <hi>thoſe who by word openly refuſe the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are viſibly ſuch unbelievers,</hi> and therefore they are ſuch viſibly to whom the Lords Supper ought not to be adminiſtred. This aſſumption I thus confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med (numb. 27.) hecauſe to profeſs to renounce Chriſt, is to profeſs not to believe; now he who ſeems ſeriouſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe his not believing, that is, his renouncing Chriſtianity, cannot be by any (rightly) judged and taken to be a believer. that is, ſuch a believer as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>I here gave an inſtance of one uncapable of rightfull admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Sacrament, and therefore not to be admitted, though he be baptized, adult, and on whom the ſentence of
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170420:79"/>the Church may not (perhaps) have paſſed for excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. (The Inſtance was of one who doth in words renounce Chriſtianity. I added <hi>[ſeriouſly]</hi> not in oppoſition to madneſs or diſtraction, (as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>W.</hi> trifles, <hi>p.</hi> 63.) For then the Inſtance would not have fitted the Queſtion; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelfe excludes the unintelligent, <hi>p.</hi> 34. but in oppoſition to both. 1. Ironicall uttering of words, which then ſignifie not what otherwiſe they would; as thoſe words are uſually interpreted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22, <hi>Behold he is become like one of us.</hi> And 2. a queſtioning or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uttering of words, which though in forme aſſertive, yet are otherwayes manifeſt to be intended not as aſſertive but proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional. So <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſpeech is fairely interpreted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.9, 16. <hi>By the life of Pharaoh, yee are all ſpyes.</hi> So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.13. <hi>Verily I have cleanſed my heart in vaine,</hi> but after he cleeres his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was only a queſtioning or doubting of it, <hi>v.</hi> 15. <hi>If I ſhould ſay thus, I ſhould offend againſt the generation of the just.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſuch an one as thus in words ſignificative of a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of Chriſtianity (where the circumſtances of uttering them, declare the meaning of the ſpeaker is not ironical, nor proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional only) doth profeſs to renounce Chriſtianity, I ſaid, is not in a capacity of rightful admiſſion to the Sacrament. And by this <hi>one Affirmative,</hi> I overthrew their <hi>univerſal negative;</hi> they ſay <hi>none</hi> adult baptized, not put off from other ordinances, may be ſuſpended or debarr'd the Sacrament: I ſay, ſuch an one as we have mentioned may; therefore their univerſal ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative propoſition is falſe except further limited.</p>

                  <p>I thinke now, there are few who underſtand any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning diſputation. but would expect, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhould have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, either by affirming that this word renouncer of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity ſhould be admitted to the Sacrament, if he tender him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to partake; or els <hi>by diſtinction,</hi> have put ſome limitation on the univerſal negative I aſſault, whereby it might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that ſuch an inſtance as this was not comprehended in it. But (to admiration) he can anſwer (and doubts not to refute mee) <hi>without denying or diſtinguiſhing:</hi> as followes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. He ſaith; <hi>But if ſuch a caſe ſhould fall out,</hi> viz. <hi>That a
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170420:79"/>man in the Church ſhould profeſſedly renounce Christianity, then he renounceth the Lords Supper too. And ſo your ſuſpenſion in this caſe would be needleſſe.—There is no need of ſuſpending or excommunicating, ſuch a wilfull renouncer of Christianity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, by diſtinguiſhing, 1. Betwixt renouncing of all the eſſential parts, and ſome eſſential part of Chriſtianity. 2. Between his renouncing the Lords Supper in particular, as to his uſing it for the end and uſe Chriſt hath appointed it for; and, renouncing it altogether, upon all accounts whatſoever. And 2. now I ſay. 1. To renounce an eſſential part of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is to renounce Chriſtianity, though a man profeſs not to renounce all the eſſential parts of Chriſtianity. It is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Chriſtianity, that Chriſt be accepted, embraced and ſubmitted to, as Lord and Saviour; to ſave us from ſin, <hi>Math.</hi> 1.21. as well as from puniſhment; therefore to reject Chriſt as Lord, is to reject Chriſtianity. He that ſaith, <hi>I beleeve Chriſt dyed for me to redeeme me from hell,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But I will not obey him, he ſhall not reigne over me, I neither will nor can ſpare my luſts (at leaſt not yet)</hi> &amp;c. <hi>doth renounce an eſſential part of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and ſo by Conſequence, Chriſtianity it ſelfe.</hi> For any eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al parr of a thing being removed, the thing it ſelfe is removed. I may ſay of our accepting Chriſt as King and Saviour, as the Epigrammatiſt ſpake of his two poyſons; <hi>Dividat haec ſi quis, faciunt diſcreta venenum: Antidotum ſumet, qui ſociata bibet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. He who thus renounceth Chriſtianity, renounceth alſo (expreſly or by conſequence) the Lords Supper, as to a maine end and uſe Chriſt hath appointed it, <hi>viz.</hi> for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging the ſoul neerer to Chriſt, and reſigning it up, in grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and holy obedience to him, <hi>who is the author of ſalvation to them who obey him.</hi> But yet he may not renounce it, as to all other reſpects; he would do as others do in the outward work, &amp;c.</p>

If to allow it, and admit him, then its all one as to this, as if he were not ſo judged of. If to exclude him; then I have what I contend for; unleſs there be no judging of a man till he be dead, and then no man can be excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated for any crime whatſoever.

To which I reply; Who hath ſaid that they are ſeales of a <hi>perſonal faith only?</hi> But doth not Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here grant (as well he may) that they are ſeales of a perſonal inward faith, though not only? Sacraments are conſidered; 1. in reſpect of the Inſtitutor and Author; 2. of the Receiver; both wayes they are ſeales, In reſpect of the Author they ſeale his tender of the Covenant of grace, wherein ſalvation is freely promiſed to all that beleeve: In reſpect of the Receivers, they are inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and appointed by God for their ſolemn ſealing or teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their beleeving, and obediential embracing of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170420:81"/>of grace in the blood of Chriſt. And as the Adminiſtrator is to attend both; ſo in ſubſerviency to his Maſter, both theſe are to be deſigned by him in the celebration of the holy my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. <hi>The ſeales</hi> (as is often ſaid) <hi>are commenſurate with the Covenant ſealed.</hi> If a ſingle covenant or meere promiſe tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to all <hi>who will beleeve, that they ſhall be ſaved,</hi> might be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the Sacraments, there were nothing in the nature of the Sacraments, which ſhould hinder the adminiſtring of them to heathens remaining ſuch; to whom this Goſpel is to be preached, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. <hi>John</hi> 3.16.

                  <p>This text requires our moſt ſerious peruſall. And here I ſhall obſerve; That though Gods ſealing or confirming his promiſe or ſingle covenant of grace is not excluded, yet this text doth very eminently refer to the ſealing or confirming of <hi>Abrahams</hi> perſonal faith; and that not only a dogmatical, but juſtifying and ſaving faith, profeſſed by him in receiving Circumciſion. The Queſtion <hi>Paul</hi> diſputes in the context is, whether a man may be juſtified without the works of the Moſaical Law as ſuch? and he proves our affirmative in the example of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Abraham</hi> was a righteous perſon, and juſtified by faith, his faith was imputed to him for righteouſneſs; that is, God dealt with him, and accepted of him through Chriſt, as if he had been perfectly righteous in himſelfe. (having pardoned his ſins, as the phraſe is explicated, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7, 8.) That this is the cleere and eaſie importance of the phraſe of <hi>imputing a thing</hi> to another, I thinke I firſt learned from our learned <hi>Wotton,</hi> on <hi>John</hi> 1.12. (a notion much better than fine gold) which is demonſtrated by two places of this Epiſtle, where the ſame manner of ſpeech is uſed; <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.26. <hi>If the uncircumciſion keep the Law, ſhall not his uncircumciſion be counted for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.</hi>

                     </gap>; that is, he ſhall fare no worſe than if circumciſed; ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 9, 8. Now that <hi>Abraham</hi> was thus juſtified without thoſe Moſaicall works, the Apoſtle proves; 1. In that he was juſtified before the workes of the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170420:81"/>Law as ſuch, were in force. For he was juſtified before he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Circumciſion (one uſe whereof afterwards was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the receivers thereof to all the Moſaical Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3.) 2. In that Circumciſion in its deſigne and intendment (and to <hi>Abraham</hi> effectually) was to be a ſeale of the righteouſneſs of faith before received: and hence (as well as from other texts) Divines ſo unanimouſly conclude, that the Sacraments are not inſtituted for the unconverted, but converted. (I ſay <hi>inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> For its vaine to ſpeake of the poſſibility of converſion in the event, by or at the Sacrament, as thence to inferre the manifeſtly prophane and unconverted may be admitted. For no one can ſay of an heathen or excommunicated perſon, if he be ſinfully preſent and partake, that he ſhall not, may not be converted at, or by that ſinfull partaking.

<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170420:82"/>thereof only, &amp;c. Theſe Rhemiſts are thus anſwered here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by our learned <hi>Cartwright: S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Paul</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth not only call Circumciſion a ſigne but a ſeale, whereby it is evident, that God ſo wrought by this ſigne, that thereby he came to a further aſſurance of his righteouſneſſe, which he had before the ſetting to of the ſeale.—And whereas they</hi> (the Papiſts) <hi>would have this righteouſneſſe, which was before the ſeale thereof, to be peculiar unto Abraham; and that in others the righteouſneſſe is not before the ſeale, but with it! It is directly contrary to the whole diſcourſe of the Apoſtle</hi>—2 <hi>Then, It is abſurd, that thus the ſeale is ſuppoſed to be put before the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, whereof it is the ſeale. And thus the Lord (which for mens better understanding borroweth his Sacraments from the common uſage of their compacts and Covenants as neere as may be) is brought firſt to ſeale, and then to write that which he ſealeth, cleane contrary to that uſage of men, from whence he draweth the reſemblance of his Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Behold here the old Proteſtant Doctrine aſlerted in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Papiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> that a perſonal faith or juſtice is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this text ſealed or confirmed, and ſuppoſed to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent in one before he comes to partake of the Sacrament. Which deſignes the ſealing of his righteouſneſſe upon his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving ſuppoſed: And that the contrary opinion is abſurd. Now alas, what impudent times are we fallen into, when men have the confidence to tell us (againſt our owne eyes) that It is a noveliſme and heterodox upſtart doctrine, now among us, that Sacraments are inſtituted and deſigned only for the converted, and for the confirming (not working of faith); when as I thinke, it will be hard for them to produce ſo much as a Proteſtant Catechiſme which aſſerts not the ſame. This booke of <hi>Cartwrights</hi> I have quoted ſo largely, was written (as the Title and Preface ſhew) by order of the chiefe Inſtruments of Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and the State, at the ſpecial Requeſt of many moſt famous and eminent Divines, <hi>Goad, Whitaker, Fulk,</hi> and ſundry others.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, that this text doth point to <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, as that which was ſealed by the Sacrament, (and not only Gods promiſe) may be ſhewed from ſeverall hints thereof in the text and context: As, 1. It was the ſeale of the <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he had before Circumciſion,</hi> which (at leaſt according to our tranſlation) denotes an inherent qualification in him, which he received a ſeale of, by ſubmitting to that ordinance
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170420:82"/>of God, appointed for the teſtifying of his faith and obedience.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That faith was ſealed, in reſpect whereof he is the <hi>Father of them who beleeve;</hi> now that was a faith inherent in him, and not only the doctrine of faith revealed to him, and others alſo in common. And they are <hi>Abrahams children</hi> in the ſenſe of the text, who walk in the ſteps of our Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> v. 12. And Chriſt tells many of the <hi>Jewes</hi> flatly (who yet had the ſame doctrine of faith revealed to them as <hi>Abraham</hi> had) <hi>If ye were Abrahams children, ye would do the works of Abraham, John</hi> 8.39. Although he acknowledgeth them <hi>Abrahams ſeed too, after the fleſh,</hi> v. 37.</p>
                  <p>Let me laſtly Inſert, D: <hi>Hammonds</hi> Paraphrafe on the text, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. <q>
                        <hi>And Abraham being juſtified after this Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal manner, upon his ſaith, without and before Circumciſion, he received the Sacrament of Circumciſion, for</hi> a ſeale on his part, <hi>of his performing thoſe commands of God given him; his walking before him ſincerely,</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>(upon which the Covenant is made to him, and thus ſealed,</hi> v. 2, 4, 10.) <hi>and on Gods part</hi>—&amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore according to this text, the Sacraments are ſeales of the mutual covenant (which only indeed is a covenant properly and ſtrictly) <hi>viz.</hi> not only of Gods ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of grace to us through Chriſt upon the condition of faith; but alſo ſeales whereby according to Gods inſtitution, we are to ratifie our accepting of thoſe Goſpel termes for juſtification in Chriſts blood; and in ſo doing receive a further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods love towards us, (in ſuch degree as we are capable of the ſenſe of it). And though God requires all them to whom the Goſpel is revealed to ſeale their acceptance thereof, yet God requires no man to ſeale he doth what he doth not, nor hath he any proper viſible right to the Sacraments, who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly rejects theſe Goſpel termes.</p>

For the ſame cavil may be about the adult; <hi>Nam de illis quoque ignoramus ficte necne accedant, an verò credant; an filij praedeſtinationis an perditionis; An Chriſti gratiam habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, an illâ ſint deſtituti, et mendaciter dicant ſe credere.

                     </q> In which doctrine of this learned man, may be ſeene (as the orthodox Proteſtants ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally I thinke do agree) that all are ſuppoſed actually in Gods favour, and made partakers of remiſſion of ſins, before they are admitted to Baptiſme. And from this and divers ſuch paſſages in him, may be ſtrongly inferred the doctrine of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion I am treating upon. (Whatſoever Mr. <hi>W.</hi> pretends of this Authors opinion to the contrary.) For if we baptize men adult, becauſe we beleeve their profeſſion, then we cannot bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them, when either they make no profeſſion, or if a verball one, which is not credible to us; and then we admit men to the Lords Supper, on the ſame account, <hi>viz</hi> becauſe we take them to be beleevers, and that <hi>non mendaciter dicentes ſe cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> but as to us and our hope of them, really and ſavingly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> He ſaid before this title agreed to Papiſts, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny in his ſenſe, it agrees to the greateſt Apoſtates that ever lived upon the earth; they are his <hi>poſitive beleevers,</hi> that is, conſecrate to the Chriſtian faith in their baptiſme, and their baptiſmal obligations ſtill lye on them, whereby they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from men of other religions, or rather from men who never were engaged in the profeſſion of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. And then I thinke it will be no great honour to have ſuch a title in ſuch a ſenſe only; when the thing of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is wanting. 2. But I have told him before, that I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them Chriſtians and Beleevers in his ſenſe, that is, they are poſitively obliged to Chriſt, and to beleeve in Chriſt: but that alone entitles them not to the Sacrament; for then none might be debarr'd who had ever been baptized. 3. And I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcharged them from celebrating the Lords Supper, no more then he doth the drunke, who yet are juſtly hindred from it; they ſin in not receiving, becauſe their hindrance is by their own fault, and yet they ought to be debarred, as hath been ſhewed before. Yea, Its manifeſt that <hi>Heathens</hi> to whom the Goſpel is preached, are <hi>as truly obliged to be baptized as theſe baptized</hi> perſons now ſpoken of, <hi>are obliged to</hi> receive the Lords Supper.

And I doubt not the ſame anſwer (if oppoſite to this) will ſerve to anſwer that concerning the Lords Supper. The thing hath been explained already, therefore I ſhall not here repeat it. 4.

                  <p>The ſum of the argumentation we have had before us here, is this, Such as in word renounce an eſſentiall of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be debarred the Sacrament though adult baptized, and not by the ſentence of the Church excluded other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; therefore ſome baptized perſons adult, and not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from other ordinances, may be debarred the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                  <p>THe Reader may be pleaſed to know, that when I had drawn up the argument before inſiſted on, I (as my manner is) ſtudied to oppoſe it my ſelf. And as I know not that the argument hath been thus made uſe of about admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; ſo I knew no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions that any had made againſt it. But I faithfully ſet down what in my own thoughts ſeemed conſiderable; and therefore alledged them not as my Antagoniſts exceptions, as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>W.</hi> inſinuates. Yet I do not ſee that he himſelf hath any thing ſo materiall to object, as I had before objected to my ſelf in theſe exceptions, which he labours (but in vain) to make good againſt my argument.</p>
                  <p>The firſt exception was (at numb. 28.) that no baptized perſon adult and not fully excommunicate, tendring himſelf to communicate, will, or doth ever ſo openly in word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt. To which I anſwered, (at numb. 29) <hi>the caſe may yet be ſuppoſed,</hi> yea it <hi>may happen.</hi> And that is a reall power for cenſure which may be exerciſed upon an occaſion which may poſſibly occurre, whether it doth actually occurre or no. In reply hereunto, he pretends not to deal with the ſubſtance of my anſwer, but promiſes to conſider it in the fourth Exception. But he hath by buſineſſes enough in the interim, to engage in, whereby the unwary Reader might be drawn away from the poynt we are upon. As the Lapwing makes a great cry to draw the paſſenger from her neſt.</p>

                  <head>§ 2.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. He is ſtill angry at the diſtinction of <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>not fully excommunicate,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>You grant a degree of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to lye upon the party debarred by your ſuſpenſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your ſuſpenſion is eſſentially excommunication, for things that differ gradually are eſſentially the ſame.</hi> p. 69.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I do grant a degree of excommunication on him who is properly ſuſpended from the Lords Supper; and therefore I told him, the queſtion ought not ſo to be ſtated, Whether one qualified as aforeſaid, and not at all excommunicated, may be debarred the Sacrament. For all Divines, I think, who hold
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170420:85"/>ſuſpenſion, do acknowledge it to be a degree of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: But whether ſuch an one as aforeſaid, not debarred all publick ordinances (according to our Antagoniſts ſenſe of excommunication) may be debarred the Lords Supper. But this plain ſenſe will not ſink into his head, and therefore he goes on thus: <hi>Your pretended Antagoniſts propound their caſe candidly, clearly, and ingenuouſly</hi> (ſee Mr. <hi>W.</hi> can give good words when he hath a mind) <hi>and ſay [not excommunicated] removing excommunication altogether from the parties they admit, &amp; look upon them as in Church-fellowſhip and communion.</hi> And do not we do ſo alſo to them we admit? The queſtion is not of them we admit, but of thoſe not admitted. <hi>But you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lay down your caſe obſcurely, fraudulently and captiouſly, as if you meant no fair dealing.</hi> And why alas? but becauſe I will not trifle in the queſtion, to enquire whether one not excommunicated may not be ſuſpended, that is in our ſenſe excommunicated? or go from my own principles, and the principles of our reformed Divines, who ſo generally hold juridicall ſuſpenſion to be an excommunication.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Things which differ <hi>Phyſically</hi> onely in degree, may differ <hi>Morally</hi> in kind; to be adjudged to have a ſmall ſcarre in the fleſh, and to have the head cut off, differ gradually, as a greater or leſſer wound: yet they are puniſhments of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind and nature; the one capitall, and the other not. The reſidue of his anſwer to the exception, is almoſt all a bundle of untruths: one of the moſt eminent whereof is this, That none with us are Church members till admitted after our examination and triall of them. And this in ſenſe divers times repeared, <hi>p.</hi> 70. And he hereupon tells us, <hi>how we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our people for Anabaptiſme.</hi> Be it known to him; the truly learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Blake</hi> and <hi>Baxter,</hi> are as likely to underſtand what is of tendency to Anabaptiſme as he, (no diſparagement to him neither,) and yet they both hold the lawfulneſs of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of ſome of the perſons mentioned in our Queſtion. And though they have ſome differences among themſelves, yet they both agree againſt M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>W.</hi> his doctrine.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond thing I added, was, The caſe of ſome ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons (qualified as aforeſaid) their renouncing Chriſt, is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeable not onely as poſſible, but probable to occurre (at numb. 30.) if (as under the Epiſcopal government) all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized perſons adult, ſhould be required under a purſe-penalty, to communicate once or twice a yeare: then many open reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170420:85"/>of Chriſtianity, and who averre there is no Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, might to eſcape the penalty, tender themſelves to receive. The ſame may be ſaid of hundreds, who account the Sacraments meer carnall things in our times.</p>
                  <p>To this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, 1. This is my <hi>malicious ſlander</hi> of the Prelaticall government. If it be a ſlander, doth he know it to be malicious too? Hath he dived into my breaſt? Good words I pray: Whence is all this heat? He tells us the 21 <hi>Canon of the Church of England,</hi> (1. Jacobi) <hi>enjoyned Miniſters ſo to order matters, that every pariſhioner might communicate at leaſt thrice in the year; but not a word of forfeiting any ſum of money in caſe they did not.</hi> But he tells us not of a 22. Canon next enſuing, which requires all to receive the Sacrament thrice a year, <hi>under the penalty and danger of the Law.</hi> But wil Mr. <hi>W.</hi> go about in this age to perſwade people, that they were not puniſhed by purſe-penalties, when preſented in the Prelaticall Courts for not receiving? and accuſe them as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſlanderers, who ſay they were? Mr <hi>W.</hi> talked of <hi>one following truth ſo cloſe that it daſh out his teeth.</hi> This is not Mr. <hi>W.</hi> he hath not loſt his teeth, he can bite deep enough I am ſure. But I am afraid his forehead is in more danger, when he can ſet a face on ſo notorious a bad buſineſſe. Were not they required under a purſe-penalty to communicate, who were commanded to receive under the penalty and danger of the Law, and felt that penalty was chargeable to their purſes.</p>

                  <head>§. 3.</head>
                  <p n="2">2. In an angry dialect he ſaith, that thoſe inſtances I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of ſuch as might deny the eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and yet probably to avoid an externall penalty, might come to communicate, <hi>do no way make for me.</hi> But he is too wiſe to tell us why they do not; Is there not a poſſibility, yea probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſuch, in ſuch a caſe would tender themſelves to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate? And did not that take off the exception, which ſaid, none ſuch would come to the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the next place he ſeems to have a mind to extol the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal government.</hi> And it is not my buſineſs to diſparage it; yet I doubt not the Presbyterian government is lawful according to Scripture. But the Reaſon he gives for the excellency of the Prelaticall government as it was in <hi>England</hi> formerly, above the preſent Eccleſiaſticall government (eſtabliſhed by the State, <hi>Aug.</hi> 29. 1648.) <hi>becauſe under that government ſuch
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170420:86"/>monſters durst not appear and proſeſſedly ſhew themſelves, as now ſwarm every where without controul.</hi> I ſay, this Reaſon is not valid. For the State-aſſiſtance then was afforded, which is not now ſo effectually, as to the execution of our government. If the State had left men to their liberty then, as much as now, it might have been even in that reſpect as bad as it is now with us, as in other reſpects it was far worſe.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. He ends with a continuall ſtrain of provoking lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which I paſs over and neglect, and he concludes all goes on his ſide, ſaith, <hi>Well, this first exception ſtands good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your aſſertion;</hi> and why? Becauſe he ſaith, <hi>Nothing I alledged hath proved, that any will or doth by word renounce Chriſt, who tenders himſelf to the Sacrament.</hi> But I told him, It was not neceſſary to deſtroy the exception, to prove any will or doth; but that it's poſſible, yea probable, there might be ſuch an one as would perpetrate ſuch wickedneſs, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denyed, I would be content to loſe my argument that it could. Who can prove that any one wil commit fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continue obſtinately under the guilt thereof viſibly in ſome particular Church? And yet it followes not thence, that ſuch wickedneſs if committed, and be notorious, is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe of Eccleſiaſticall cenſure. And our preſent caſe, as to the probability of its occurring, is the like.</p>

                  <p>A Second Exception I laid in againſt my Argument, was this, (at numb. 32.) That ſuch perſons as aforeſaid, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring themſelves to receive, cannot openly at that time pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their rejecting Chriſt, becauſe in the tender of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to this Ordinance, they offer to profeſs the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> their owning of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>To the which I anſwered, 1. That the caſe under our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſideration, ſuppoſeth him at the ſame time, when he tenders himſelf to be admitted to the communion, to profeſs (being asked) againſt his owning of Chriſt, <hi>q. d. I deſire to do as others do in receiving; but I am reſolved at preſent I will not ſubmit to the commands of Chriſt, nor part with my luſts which he bids me flye from.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> now to take off this anſwer, beſides uncivil chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings here both in the Preface and Epilogue, hath onely one thing (which I hope was but a miſtake in him) to alledge. <hi>Is it your practice</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to provoke men in the open face of the congregation, by asking them queſtions, when they come hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and reverently to celebrate the Lords Supper with their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is our practice to know thoſe who communicate before the time of celebration come, and then when they ſignifie their intention to receive (eſpecially ſuch as have not joyned with us before) is a ſpeciall ſeaſon we lay hold on, if any notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſs in one who tenders himſelf give occaſion, to admoniſh him concerning the ſame. And then is the time for ſuſpenſion if there be juſt cauſe, not in the moment of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration, (there would be the execution of ſuſpenſion if one ſuſpended ſhould thruſt in thither, by refuſing to adminiſter to him.) We have no ſuch queſtioning there; the caſe had no reference to it. But it was thus, as for example, If a perſon notoriouſly known to live in whoredome, and keeping a ſtrumpet in his houſe, ſhall tender himſelf ſome convenient time before the day of celebration of the Sacrament; and then be asked, Whether he will leave his wanton? and he
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170420:87"/>anſwer, No, he cannot leave that vice, he hopes God will be mercifull to him notwithſtanding, and yet he deſires to receive as others do; will Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſay it was unlawfull or unſeaſonable then to ask him that queſtion? and doth not the ſaid vicious perſon by profeſſed refuſing to repent of, and leave his luſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce an eſſentiall of Chriſtianity, and therefore renounceth Chriſt, notwithſtanding his tendring himſelf to be admitted to the communion drawing on. And was not this according to the order formerly appointed in the Church of <hi>England?</hi> See the Rubrick before the communion, where it is thus ordered. <q>
                        <hi>So many as intend to be partakers of the holy communion, ſhall ſignifie their Names to the Curate over night, or elſe in the morning before the beginning of morning Prayer, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly after. And if any of thoſe be an open and notorious evil liver, or have done any wrong to his neighbour in word or deed: the Curate having knowledge thereof, ſhall call him and advertiſe him, in any wiſe, not to preſume to the Lords Table, untill, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>This miſtake being diſcovered, I ſhall not need to inſiſt on the anſwering divers other paſſages Mr <hi>W.</hi> hath after in his Book, which are grounded on this unreaſonable catch.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. My ſecond anſwer to this ſecond Exception was, It's not impoſſible for ſuch a man to profeſs contradictions, ſo that you cannot conclude he profeſſeth not againſt Chriſt, becauſe he profeſſeth for Chriſt, at the ſame time, or in one breath. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> replie, <hi>Yea we can and ought in the judgment of charity ſo to conclude:</hi> and he would put me off with this ſlurre, <hi>ſhould we ſay it's not impoſſible for you to profeſſe contradictions, you would rather laugh at our folly, then conceive your ſelfe guilty.

                  <p>A third anſwer to this ſecond Exception I ſuggeſted thus, (at numb. 34.) he then denies Chriſt expreſly, he profeſſeth to receive Chriſt onely by conſequence, from the nature of the ordinance he deſires to joyn in; although perhaps he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands it not, or doth plainly reject his owning of that conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                  <p>The Exception to which this third anſwer was fitted, muſt be remembred to be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That a perſon baptized, &amp;c. and tendring himſelf to receive, cannot openly at that time profeſs his rejecting Chriſt, becauſe that in this tender of himſelf to this ordinance, he offers to profeſs the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> his owning of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now in reply to my ſaid third ſolution of this objection, the leſs Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath of weight and pertinent, the more doth he powre out gall and bitterneſſe, <hi>p.</hi> 80, 81, 82, 83. And, 1. He ſaith; My <hi>anſwer is not ſo large as the exception. The caſe is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>concerning a baptized perſon [adult, intelligent, and unexcommunicate] tendring himſelfe to receive the Lords Supper; the Query is this,</hi> viz. <hi>Whether ſuch a perſon at that time in the tendring himſelfe can be ſaid herein, to reject Chriſt or Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Heres the miſtake continued I before diſcovered, taking the time of actuall celebration of the Sacrament, in ſtead of the time of tendring himſelfe to be admitted to the ſacramen-approaching. 2. He ſeemes to intimate that I had ſaid, the very tendring himſelfe to communicate was a renouncing of Chriſt; which no word of mine ever ſignified, and I am apt to thinke Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelfe hath ſo much charity towards mee as to hope that abſurdity never entred my thoughts. 3. If there were a defect in what I here propounded, it was in delivering
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170420:88"/>of the exception, not in the anſwer thereunto. The anſwer is manifeſtly as large as the exception; and though The exception only mentioned a perſon baptized, the other limitations of [adult, intelligent, and unexcommunicate] were excluded, according to the former explications given, in ſtating the Queſtion, not neceſſary ever and anon to be repeated at large, 4. Yet as to the particular matter we are now upon, Its all one whether all theſe limitations be taken in or no; our preſent Query is, whether he that tenders himſelfe to be admitted to the Communion, can at that time (not in that act of tendring himſelfe, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> wildly layes it) profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renounce Chriſt? The which I ſay he doth who renounceth profeſſedly any eſſential of Chriſtianity, notwithſtanding his tendring himſelfe to receive. And as to this particular, its all one whether he were before excommunicate or not.</p>
                  <p>And yet Is it not a very good Jeſt, that whiles Mr. <hi>W.</hi> thus induſtriouſly ſeekes for flawes where there are none, but what his greedy deſire of finding ſome hath imprinted in his own phanſie; he yet here ſaith, <hi>he muſt winke at ſmall ſaults in mee.</hi> He may winke at my faults, I grant, but I thinke then, he winkes not cloſe, but only contracts his peepers, that his eyes may ſee, and <hi>his eyelids too may try my failings;</hi> or if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he winke cloſe, its but with one eye, and that the right, that with the left, he may take a ſiniſter aime at, and more peircingly pry into my ſuppoſed defects.</p>

The terme [Admiſſioniſts] which for brevity ſake in that private <hi>M S.</hi> I had inſerted, I could wiſh had been omitted, and in ſtead thereof ſuch a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſis as this, [our brethren for the general admiſſion plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for] had been placed. And ſome paſſages beſides I thinke might have been more conveniently expreſſed, and probably would have been, if I had ſuſpected their publication.— But I am afraid it was anger, rather than modeſty which brought the red into his face on this occaſion; or having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to murther my good name, with the blood thereof, he dyes his checkes, and would be accounted ſhamefaſt. —</p>

                  <p>THe Reader may be pleaſed to remember, that the Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is whether any ſuch qualifi'd, as aforeſaid, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred the Sacrament? I ſuppoſed the caſe of one by word re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Chriſtianity (or ſome eſſential part thereof) who, I ſaid, though ſo qualified as the Queſtion puts him, (to wit, baptized, adult, intelligent, and not fully excommunicate) may be debarred; and if ſo, then their univerſal negative, <hi>that none ſo qualified might be debarred,</hi> is manifeſtly falſe. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> often hath anſwered; that he excepts againſt the caſe. I no where finde him ſaying that in ſuch a caſe this perſon ſhould not be debarred; but he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 83. <hi>Our exception lyes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that very ſuppoſition, and you do but repeat your own caſe, againſt which we except.</hi> And often elſwhere, he ſaith this ſame thing.

                  <p>If it be a valid exception againſt an argument which makes ſuppoſition of the preſent caſe ſuppoſed, to ſay that caſe ought not to be ſuppoſed; It is either becauſe the caſe ſuppoſeth whats impoſſible, or what never was, is, nor ſhall be exiſtent; or for ſome of theſe, or ſome other Reaſon.

He ſuppoſeth to them that an Idolater ſhould come without renouncing his Idolatry, and asks them whether they would admit him to Baptiſme, (though perhaps this caſe never occurred) and thence he argues againſt their admitting of notorious fornicators, without renouncing that their wickedneſſe before. <q>

                  <p>ANd now I ſhall wait on Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his animadverſions on the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> exception I ſet down againſt my Argument, and my ſolution thereof. The exception was (at <hi>numb.</hi> 37.) That there is no ſuch inſtance in our times of a word-renouncer of Chriſtianity, when he tenders himſelfe to be admitted to the Communion. And therfore we need not perplex our ſelves, with forecaſting what might be done in ſuch an extraordinary caſe. But the preſent controverſie is concerning ſuch as in word pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to own Chriſt, when they tender themſelves to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municate, although there be viſible teſtimony that their lives are not hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto agreeable to their profeſſion. My ſolution hereof was (at <hi>numb.</hi> 38, 39. &amp;c) The ſumme whereof is; Its no need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe point of wiſdome, to labour to foreſee, the neceſſary ill
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170420:91"/>conſequents. which may enſue upon the receiving a principle, although at preſent there is not opportunity for the exiſtence of them.—And thoſe evince the principle not ſound. If ſuſpenſion then in the caſe propoſed, cannot be denied, then it muſt not be univerſally rejected.</p>
                  <p>Now Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his reply hereto; 1. affixeth on mee, as if I owned what was put in the exception, <hi>viz.</hi> that the caſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed was an extraordinary Inſtance, and that the preſent controverſie is concerning ſuch as in words profeſs Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and ſo he thinkes to beat me with my own conceſſions. Is not this brave diſputing, that what I brought in as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt my argument, ſhould be taken for my own aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion? Yet this he takes for a confutation of me, <hi>p.</hi> 86, 87. and doth ſo far preſume on the ſillineſs of his Readers, as to tell them hereupon, <hi>that I am in a wood, and know not which way to get out.</hi> I came indeed among briars and thornes when I fell into Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his hands, and I ſhall hardly get out without receiving ſome markes of his ſharpneſſe. But that may ſeeme to ſome (eſpecially mine Antagoniſt) an extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Inſtance, which is not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Againe; I would diſtinguiſh, a caſe may be ſaid to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in a twofold reſpect; 1. in reſpect of the rare and ſeldome occurring of it; ſo of inceſt or parricide, the Inſtances may be extraordinary. Or 2. in reſpect of the Rule whereby a caſe is to be diſcerned and judged of, which may differ from the ordinary Rule. As the ordinary Rule determines inceſt unlawfull, but an extraordinary temporary Rule made it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for <hi>Adams</hi> immediate children to marry together. And now whereas Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Extraordinary Inſtances happening in the courſe of Gods extraordinary providence, cannot infringe the truth of a general Rule, true in the courſe of Gods ordinary providence.</hi> And addes; <hi>This is a Rule that beſt Divines walk by, notwithſtanding your pretended skill in Logick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What pretended skill in Logick did I ever boaſt of? What an impotent ſcoffe is this? how iucoherently and abruptly brought in? If I might anſwer Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in his own way I ſhould ſay, perhaps he may preſume of his artificial Logick, eſpecially in the firſt part, <hi>both of the peripatetick,</hi> for he is good at ſuch <hi>ſimple termes,</hi> as <hi>mormo, mormonize,</hi> and the like, <hi>and the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtical;</hi> one would be apt to thinke his <hi>Invention</hi> is too great, by the figments he hath publiſhed concerning mee. But a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more natural Logick, its humbly conceived, would not
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170420:92"/>make him (no more then me) an overplus. For I thinke the Preface he printed before his firſt Errata Table to this booke, argues no overflowing of his diſcretion; the Preface was this; <hi>Chriſtian Reader, my remoteneſs from London, and the miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of my Letters by the Post, have cauſed many overſights to paſs (in this impreſſion) without timely correction. And that now I may not be diſappointed, I have committed my buſineſs to honeſt</hi> Randal Foſter, <hi>Carrier of</hi> Leek, <hi>who is ſure and truſty, though but ſlow in his motion.</hi> But to the thing I anſwer, by applying the former diſtinction, and ſay the Rule mentioned is true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing underſtood in the latter ſenſe not in the former. Now our caſe if it may be called <hi>extraordinary,</hi> its ſo only in reſpect of the ſeldome occurring of it, not in reſpect of any extraordinary Rule appointed for the judging of it, differing from the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Rule, which determines that unbeleevers in the ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove explained, are not to be admitted to the Sacraments.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. He ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 89, 90 <hi>Why must wiſe men be of ſuch a long proviſo, to provide ſo long before-hand, againſt ſuppoſed evils of future contingency, which haply may never fall out? or if they come to paſs, ſhall it be imputed to their folly, that they had not provided themſelves with remedies against unknown evils, which poſſibly may come to paſs? What fools then were the primitive Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Church, that they could not foreſee the evil of hereſies; but muſt aſſemble in Councils after they aroſe, and had no inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous remedy to put a ſudden check thereunto. Nay, what fooles were the very Apoſtles, that they did not foreſee the evill of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing, that they muſt goe up to Jeruſalem to conſult about a Remedy after the evill aroſe? Doubtleſs, all theſe wanted ſome of your ſuſpenſion wiſdome. Thoſe old times did not afford men of ſuch a prudential forecast, as the preſent age doth.</hi>—</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Ranting Language I'le skip over, as a dirty puddle in my way. 2. The contingency of the offences happening, doth not make that a Rule ſhould not be neceſſary for the ordering of them. For there is a contingency in the hapning of adultery, drunkenneſs, or any ſuch offence, for which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication is to be inflicted on an offender, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. And theſe in the nature of the things themſelves, are as much contingent and caſuall events, as that our preſent caſe ſuppoſed of a word-renouncing of Chriſtianity. And the Rule for excluſion reacheth this as well as thoſe. 3. Hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, we are to admit no principle contrary to this Rule, in
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170420:92"/>this no more than thoſe. If I hold ſuch a Principle as doth ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily inferre, That no inceſtuous perſon may be debarred, the not occurring of ſuch an offence doth not make the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to be true. And therefore I am to renounce that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, whether inceſt be ever committed or no.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The examples Mr <hi>W.</hi> pretends to the contrary, are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impertinent. They concern either firſt, the foreſeeing of offences which after did occurr, whereas the point we are upon, is the foreſeeing an irregularity which would follow upon a principle in caſe ſuch offences do occurre: the former we are not bound to foreſee, the later we are. Or ſecondly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the execution of a Rule before known, in ſuch manner as may be moſt for the edification of the Church; in reference to which there will be continuall need of new conſultations as long as the world ſtands; becauſe of the varying circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of places, times and perſons, and the exigencies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Councils now do not make new principles, when a new caſe occurres, but conſult for the better improvement and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of principles already received, in reference there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The very edge therefore of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his Similies turnes, and ſo will not at all touch the nerves of this my firſt Solution, given by me to the fourth exception pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded.</p>

                  <p>My ſecond anſwer to the exception of the extraordinarineſs of this caſe I had ſuppoſed (at numb. 39.) was, <hi>That though this caſe ſeem ſo rare and extraordinary</hi> (which explication of <hi>rare</hi> by extraordinary, ſhewed, I meant thereby rarely or ſeldome occurring as before) <hi>yet by neceſſary conſequence it concludes</hi> (not includes as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> prints me) <hi>other instances of daily and ordinary incurſion.</hi> For if he who in words rejects Chriſt, may be debarred, then he who by ſome notorious deeds rejects Chriſt (though not in words) may be debarred, though he be a perſon baptized, adult, and not fully excommunicate. The further Mr <hi>W.</hi> goes on, the more doth he go out, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagate: and where he hath (as appears to me) leaſt colour of argumentation, and leaſt pincheth my papers, there is he moſt confident and cenſorious. I ſhall meddle as little with ſuch ſtuff as I can, but ſome is ſo interwoven with what ſeems more materiall, that it wil not be ſundred. But to the matter I would deſign my Reply. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 94. <hi>Few would have imagined how rare and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170420:93"/>extraordinary ſhould by neceſſary conſequence have concluded daily and ordinary.</hi> This cavill is anſwered in the laſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, by diſtinguiſhing of the word <hi>ordinary.</hi> From the Rule of ſome things which ſeldome occurre, concluſions may be drawn in reference to things which frequently occurre. From <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> being juſtified in believing that ſingular promiſe, that <hi>in his ſeed ſhould all the nations of the earth be bleſſed,</hi> is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded juſtification by faith in generall of all them who are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. From the promiſe made to <hi>Joſhua, to be with him</hi> (eſpecially in conquering Canaan, which was an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and rare caſe, is concluded, that God will be with his people in ordinary caſes of daily incurſion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.5. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Joſh.</hi> 1.5. Divers ſuch examples there are in Scripture. Our Proteſtant Divines diſputing againſt juſtification by works in the Popiſh ſenſe, &amp; their doctrine of Purgatory from the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular inſtance of the Thief on the Croſs, who went immediatly to heaven, <hi>Gerrard</hi> obſerves, <hi>Harm.

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, let me add further, that it's uſuall in Scripture to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Caſes, which (for ought we know) never were nor ſhall be exiſtent, and from thence to conclude matters of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and frequent incurſion. <hi>Nathan the Prophet,</hi> 2 Sam. 12. ſuppoſeth the caſe of a rich man taking the poor mans Ewe for his gueſt, and the grievouſneſs of that offence ſo ſuppoſed, being granted, he thence concludes the hainouſneſs of <hi>Davids</hi> wickedneſs committed by him in the point of <hi>Uriah.</hi> This was an uſuall way of arguing with Chriſt Jeſus, for the conviction of the Jewes: there are many inſtances thereof in the Goſpels: there are two of this nature, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. He there ſuppoſeth a man who had two ſons, and he commanding them to go and work in his vineyard, the one ſaid, I go Sir, and went not; the other ſaid he will not go, and yet went.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170420:93"/>And thence concludes, that the Publicans and Harlots enter into the kingdome of heaven before many of the Jewes. So likewiſe he ſuppoſeth an Houſholder planting a Vineyard, and letting it out to Husbandmen, and how injuriouſly and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly they dealt with his ſervants and ſon, and how ſeverely they were puniſhed; and thence concludes againſt the Jewes for their abuſing the Prophets, and rejecting Chriſt himſelf; as they themſelves perceived, verſe 45. The force of ſuch arguments lies not in the exiſtence of the caſe ſuppoſed, but in the merits of the cauſe ſuppoſed, and in the parallel and likeneſs betwixt the caſe ſuppoſed, and their caſes whom he deals with. <hi>Comparata etiam ficta arguunt fidemque faciunt.</hi> as <hi>P. Ramus</hi> rightly obſerves, and gives many examples there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Dialect. l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 18. So here, whether word-renouncer of Chriſtianity be exiſtent or no, if he be to be debarred the Sacrament, and the caſe of one who in deeds rejects Chriſt, be parallel to that, as to a viſible renouncing of Chriſt, the Argument is valid from the former to the debarring of the later.</p>

And Chriſt Jeſus makes theſe two phraſes of <hi>rejecting him,</hi> and <hi>not receiving his word,</hi> of equall importance, <hi>John</hi> 12.48. And would to God this were not too ordinary and frequent!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> adds, <hi>p.</hi> 96, 97. <hi>Perhaps ſome of your reverend Paſtors &amp; grave Elders, may poſsibly be involved in the crime. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeable, nay poſsible (to uſe your own weapon) that ſuch may be word- or deed-rejecters of Chriſt in your ſenſe. If ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary emergent as this appears, who then ſhall ſuſpend the Pariſh Pope, or his Veſtry Cardinals? They will haply have a privat Maſs, though none of the Congregation wil joyn with them. In this ſuppoſable caſe which poſsibly may occur, though it doth never actually occur, what inſtantaneous Remedy have you? Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks ſuch wiſe men as you ſhould foreſee the evill, and be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170420:94"/>with an instantaneous Remedy against it, when ſuch a caſe ſhall occur, though it never actually doth occur. Shall I retort upon you this Counter-buff,</hi> viz. <hi>That God hath placed a power ſomewhere in his Church for the inſtantaneous checking of this ſuppoſable evil? or elſe must you renounce your principle, which upon a cloſe purſuit will caſt you on this rock? We onely here improve your Argument to ſuch further uſefulneſſe as you never expected; and the improvement is rather good against you than againſt us, becauſe it is your own argument.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Deſpiſing his ſcornfull language, I anſwer. 1. Mr <hi>W.</hi> doth here manifeſtly abuſe me. For in his <hi>Counter-buffe</hi> (as he calls it) he puts this Pofition down in a different Character, as if it had been mine aſſertion and words, <hi>viz. That God hath placed a power ſomewhere in his Church, for the inſtanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous checking of this</hi> ſuppoſable evill. The paſſage of mine he alludes to, was in the beginning of the Argument, where one propoſition in my Syllogiſme was, Thoſe who are viſibly ſuch as the Lord hath in his word, declared to be perſons, to whom he would not have the Lords Supper adminiſtred, may be ſuſpended from the Lords Supper. And this I ſaid, is clear; becauſe <hi>God hath placed a power ſomewhere in his Church for the managing his Ordinances ſo, as they may not be diſpenſed to ſuch as he hath declared in his word, he would not have them adminiſtred unto.</hi> And I had before limited the Queſtion thus, That we are not now enquiring by what power any may be ſuſpended, but only concerning the lawfulneſs of the act of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the perſons mentioned in the queſtion, by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or perſons whatſoever, in whatſoever capacity they are, or by whatſoever kind of power it may be exerted by them, or any of them. So that if it were lawfull for a Generall Council to ſuſpend, it proved the aſſertion ſufficiently which I undertook. You ſee then, 1. that the expreſſion of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneous remedy</hi> he talkes on, was not mine, but his own. 2. Beſides, we may diſtinguiſh of debarring, 1. by a Rule for debarring: and 2. by the execution of that debarring the Rule appoints. In the former ſenſe, there's an <hi>Instantaneous remedy</hi> (as he ſpeakes) in the caſe propounded by him; to keep the ordinances from being diſpenſed to ſuch as have no actuall right thereunto: For the word of God ſo debarres them, that they ought not to approach to the ſeal of the Covenant, without their reall and preſent accepting of the Covenant-terms, which they cannot do, whiles they lye under notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170420:94"/>wickedneſs unrepented of. In the later ſenſe there may not be ever an inſtantaneous remedy to execute the Rule effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. But we are not diſputing what men do, but what they ought to do according to Scripture-Rule. He might in the ſame manner trifle about ſuſpending the unclean from the Paſſcover, and ſay, But what if the Prieſts and Governours were to keep back the Legally unclean, were ſo unclean them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who muſt ſuſpend them? and hence argue, that they might not debarre others, becauſe there was none to debarre them, or not inſtantly; when as yet the Rule debarred them as well as others; and they ſinned in not complying with it themſelves, as well as in not executing the ſame for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barring of others.</p>
                  <p>And thus the Reader may perceive our Gentlemans Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-buffe, is but the blind-mans-buff, and fitter for an hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winkt boy than a learned cenſurer of others Logick. But, O my ſoul, ſtop here; reſtrain, yea, extinguiſh the riſe of a ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming juſt indignation by attending wholly to the divine and calming meditation of,</p>

If word rejecters of Chriſtianity, though baptized, adult, and not fully excommunicate, may be debarred the Sacrament, then alſo ſome ſuch deed-rejecters of Chriſtianity may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred, my paper proved (at <hi>numb.</hi> 42.) as is related by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> p. 98, 99.

                  <p>I ſhall now gather up the ſumme of what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers for the enervating thereof, and then having compared my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations with the pretended ſolutions he returnes thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, I ſhall make my Reply to them ſeverally, and then adde more proofe for the confirmation of my Conſequence afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 99. <hi>We begin now to feare the feverity of your Church Officers: But our comfort is, that neither</hi> Titus 1.16. <hi>nor</hi> 1 Cor. 5. <hi>nor</hi> Math. 18.15, 16. <hi>nor</hi> Rev. 2.2. <hi>doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh your ſuſpenſion, nor command us to ſubmit to your Church Officers.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The Queſtion now in agitation with us is, Whether open ſcandalous and preſumptuous offenders in the Church, are to be puniſhed by the diſcipline of the Church? We affirme poſitively that they are</hi>—ſuch offenders <hi>in words or deeds.—The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of theſe do fall properly under Eccleſiastical diſcipline; yet not ſo as the Chriſtian Magiſtrate is to be excluded—And yet all this doth not inferre the neceſſity of your ſuſpenſion, as a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure distnct from excommunication;</hi> viz. <hi>that every Pariſh Prieſt with his Elders (after his own humour) ſhould be Judge in his own cauſe, uſe partiality, exclude men from the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, meerely at his pleaſure, for not ſubmitting to his Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though otherwiſe judicious and of good example, albeit the cry be against men ignorant, and of groſs behaviour!</hi> — And then tells us, <hi>Its fit the correcting diſcipline ſhould lye in indifferent and impartial hands, more publique then the Pariſh Prieſt and his Elders.—And oft-times it will fall out, that a Pastour and his Elders will be Judges in their own cauſe, and then ſuſpenſion was become private revenge, and parties will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Judges;</hi> All this, <hi>p.</hi> 101, 102.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. He askes; <hi>Is your Parochial ſuſpenſion with your Claſſical power in being (by toleration civil) an univerſal Remedy againſt all the Errours that belong to Eccleſiaſtical cognizance? As yet you have no place for publique Judicature allowed by the State, no Power to iſſue out Warrants for the legall ſummoning in of offenders. And therefore your proceedings in ſuſpenſion are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all form of Law,</hi> p. 103.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>I ſee that</hi> (ipſo facto) <hi>men must be ſuſpended (by you) for their former miſcarriages, and preſent words of ſorrow, and of promiſing obedience for the future, muſt not ſerve the turne.</hi> This he inſiſts on in many words, <hi>p.</hi> 103, 104, 105, 106, 107. and labours to confute mee by <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.4. and askes, <hi>Whether the Church, (which is</hi> coetus miſericors, <hi>and deales not against men in rigour of Juſtice, but with bowels of mercy) may not take mens preſent words of repentance for a reall diſſenting from their former evill deeds, and beleeve in charity, that their word-Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Repentance are ſerious Retractations of their former evil deeds?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now I deſire the Reader to do himſelfe, Mr. <hi>W,</hi> and me that right, as to compare theſe five anſwers ſeverally and joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with my argumentation, which ſhould be confuted by them; and let him try his beſt skill to fit them thereunto. My reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the confirmation of my Conſequence, recited in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, (which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here aſſaults) thus proceeded; If the above mentioned Conſequence (from the ſuſpenſion of word-Rejecters of Chriſt, to the ſuſpenſion of ſome deed-Rejecters of Chriſt) do not hold, it is either becauſe no deed-rejection of Chriſt is ſo manifeſt, viſible and hainous a rejection of Chriſt, as word-rejecting of Chriſt is; or els be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Officers in the Church, have ſome good Rule accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which they may diſpenſe with, or not deny the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for deed-rejecting of Chriſt, rather then word rejecting of Chriſt, or for ſome other Reaſon. But neither of theſe do enervate the Conſequence, nor any other Reaſon, therefore its good and valid: not the latter, becauſe no ſuch Rule can be produced, but rather the contrary, <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Math.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.2. Not the former, becauſe, &amp;c.— which may be peruſed (at <hi>numb.</hi> 44, 45.)</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in anſwering hereof, doth neither aſſert, that either of the Reaſons mentioned, doth enervate my Conſequence, nor fault the enumeration of obſtructive Reaſons which might
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170420:96"/>enervate it, nor aſſigne any other. And yet his foreſaid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes muſt ſerve for ſolutions, and he in the ſtrength of them thus flouriſheth it out, and ſhews his mettle, <hi>p.</hi> 108. <hi>The proofe of your Conſequence we have examined at large, we have ſhewed Cauſes, why we cannot approve of it; You may take time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and reply if you have any ſtomack to the undertaking. But (I feare me) you will conſider of it ten times, before you will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it once.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truly I may conſider it twenty times, before I can finde any thing herein pertinent, for me to reply unto: ſuch an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary may ſafely challenge and provoke to Diſputation. Did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any <hi>Quaker</hi> returne a more impertinent pretended ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to an Argument? And yet they will be as bold as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelfe hath attained to be, and tell you, no body dare or can anſwer them. And under the ſhelter of that their irrational impudence, they often eſcape Replyes to them. And ſo might Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for mee, if others Judgement had not prevail'd againſt my owne for this once; hereafter I hope my Friends will not urge me in this kinde any more.</p>
                  <p>But though theſe his five Reaſons againſt my Conſequence, (ſo you ſee he calls them, elſe I had wanted a name for them; as the Painter that wrote <hi>[This is a Lyon]</hi> over the picture he had drawne, that no body ſhould take it for a Bull) though I ſay theſe his anſwers are manifeſtly <hi>nihil ad Rhombum,</hi> yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be thought, he may, like a ſquinting Fencer, wound me ſome where els by them, though he touch not the place he makes a ſhew to aime at; I ſhall therefore ſatisfie his importunity this once, as I have ſometimes gratified the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> to make ſome reply to them ſeverally; and then I ſhall (as I promiſed) confirme my own argumentation.</p>

                  <p>To his firſt; Its plaine I cited not thoſe texts to prove ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion immediately; I brought them to prove that Church Officers have no good Rule according to which they may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with deed rejecting of Chriſt, any more then with word-rejecting of Chriſt, in point of ſacramental adminiſtrations, thus; If there be a deed rejecting of Chriſt, for which Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Cenſure is to be inflicted, as wel as for a word reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt; then the Church Officers have no Rule to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with or not deny the Sacrament for the former rather than the latter. The Antecedent is proved by the texts quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; <hi>Titus</hi> 1.16. <hi>In words they profeſs Chriſt, in deeds they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170420:96"/>deny him:</hi> And the other texts proved a deed-rejecting of Chriſt, (yea when in words Chriſt is owned) to be cauſes of Eccleſiaſtical Cenſure, and therefore as truly as word rejecting of Chriſt is.</p>
                  <p>To his ſecond, I ſay, Mr. <hi>W.</hi> it ſeemes hath found one man, as bold as himſelfe, to reproach Elders without offering any Argument againſt them, or invalidating thoſe produced for them. A confident man as I have lightly met with, who though then a private Chriſtian, as he ſtiles himſelfe, without bluſhing, tells us in his Epiſtle to the Reader before his <hi>Bar removed; I looke to be cenſured for this my preſumption, in diſſenting from the common interpretation of ſeveral Scriptures, and aſſerting ſome things againſt the judgement of many, or moſt Divines and godly Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Aſſault Humphreys and Timſon,</hi> crys Mr. <hi>W.</hi> p. 48. <hi>The men like Ingenuous Worthyes appeare in print,</hi> &amp;c. Its pitty that ſuch a learned and ingenuous Divine as Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> appeares to be, ſhould be yoakt ſo unſutably with Mr. <hi>Timſon.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys</hi> wants not aſſaulting, Mr. <hi>Timſon</hi> (as to our controverſie) will not I thinke deſerve an aſſault; untill now (in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique capacity Mr. <hi>W.</hi> intimates) he gaine the repute of leſſe arrogance and more learning than his former writings (ſo far as they reach our caſe) have diſcovered. If ſuch a man as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Humphreys,</hi> will pick out that which lookes as conſiderable in this controverſie in <hi>Timſon,</hi> it would ſooner be anſwered. But I wonder not Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>Timſon</hi> ſo well agree; For they are both good at provoking words; and its a jolly Champion whoſe name Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath mentioned 26 times (I take it), in his booke. When I have little els to doe I may perhaps anſwer him as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> challengeth mee. But I hope to be better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. And the truth is, I agree with him and Mr. <hi>Humphreys</hi> in ſo many things (they treat of) for ſubſtance, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of anſwering them is not ſo proper for me as their pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Antagoniſts. But ſee what an anſwer this is: <hi>Timſon</hi> is againſt Elders, <hi>Ergo</hi> theres no conſequence from the ſuſpenſion of word rejecters of Chriſt, to the ſuſpenſion of deed-rejecters of Chriſt. <hi>Sampſons</hi> new withes will not tye theſe together. This is to diſpute at a low rate indeed.</p>

If it were not fit the correcting diſcipline ſhould lye in the hands he excepts againſt, becauſe of their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation with them who ſhould be corrected, which may cauſe partiality; then the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Officers ſhould not have had in their hands the correcting diſcipline wherewith to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Inceſtuous perſon, becauſe (forſooth) he was among them; and they might (if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had been their prompter) have evaded the Apoſtles objurgation for neglect of diſciplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and have ſaid, It was not fit for us, who live with him, to cenſure him; ſome body els more remote, (who might be preſumed more impartial) ſhould have taken him in hand. And belike the ſame Reaſon would as well perſwade Juſtices of peace, that its not fit for them to take cognizance of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among their neighbours; they are fit to miniſter Juſtice to thoſe who are remote from them, not to them who cohabite with them, in the ſame Hundred or Pariſh. And yet though Mr. <hi>W.</hi> talkes thus <hi>conſideratly,</hi> (as he ſaith himſelfe, <hi>p.</hi> 103.) yet a while agoe he ſeemed to have a better mind to exerciſe diſcipline among his neighbours, if the State would enough aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt him therein. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>p.</hi> 90. <hi>we have ordinary caſes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in being for the full exerciſe of Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline, had we power from the Chriſtian Magiſtrate to convent offenders before us authoritatively, and to inflict puniſhments upon them (after their legal conviction) according to the quality of their crimes; and ſhould not rather be a ludibrium to bold offenders, then any way reform them.</hi>

                  <p>His fifth Anſwer or Reaſon againſt my foreſaid conſequence, is a meere fiction, the product (I thinke) of an extravagant phanſie, and too fruitfull an invention, ratified and excited by a paſſionate heat. I never ſaid that former acts of wickedneſſe, though amounting to a rejecting of an eſſential of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor yet word-rejecting of Chriſt, when retracted by a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble repentance, ſhould debar any from the Sacrament. They are then cancelld and blotted out, when repented of, and are no more to be mentioned againſt the offender. As <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 55. <hi>Cornelio fratri.</hi>

                     </q> But as in the beginning of the argument I ſpake all along of a word-rejecting Chriſt, which a perſon is found in, when he tenders himſelfe to communicate; ſo here the deed rejecting of Chriſt was ſuch as he was then viſibly <hi>ſtill</hi> guilty of; which he is not, when he hath ſeriouſly retracted it by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and promiſe of Reformation.

                  <p>ANd now having anſwered Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his Reaſons (as he cal'd them) The Reader may diſcerne how my argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concerning deed-rejecters of Chriſt their ſuſpenſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines untouched by him, much more unwounded and ſafe. But becauſe the point is of great influence into the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, I ſhall adde ſomewhat more hereunto, to prove that <hi>notorious groſs wickedneſſe</hi> (continued in, without viſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of it) <hi>is and ought to be taken</hi> (in the judgement of the governing Church, or where there is no governing Church in the judgement of the Miniſter officiating) <hi>as equivalent to word-Rejecting of Christ; and therefore equally renders a perſon uncapable of having the Lords Supper administred unto him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The argument I before propounded (at <hi>numb.</hi> 44, 45) was to this purpoſe; If words are no otherwiſe teſtimonies, then as they ſignifie the mind of the ſpeaker; then words of profeſſion for owning Chriſtianity, are not ſignificative of the mind in that profeſſion, when there are ſome ſuch deeds at preſent owned which do more probably ſignifie the mind to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This conſequence is cleere, becauſe the uſe of words is to be ſignes of things; when they manifeſtly are not ſo, they ceaſe to have the uſe of ſignifying the mind in the thing ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. <hi>Verba quid audio facta cum videam? Cyprian de uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate eccleſiae catholicae,</hi> ſaith <hi>Credere ſe in Chriſtum quomodo dicit, qui non facit quod Christus ſacere praecipit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Antecedent alſo is manifeſt. For,</p>

                  <p n="1">1. In other matters ſome deeds practiced and continued in, render words to the contrary incredible; and there is the ſame reaſon of them and this caſe, as to the thing wherein I now
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170420:99"/>compare them. The command is to <hi>Give to him that needeth;</hi> but every one who ſaith he needeth, is not to be taken for a needy perſon, when as the contrary other wiſe appeares to us, by his abundance viſibly under his hand, and his large and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary expences. So he that <hi>repents is to be forgiven,</hi> but he that ſays <hi>he repents</hi> is not to be beleeved, when actually and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly he continues in the wickedneſſe he ſaith <hi>he repents of: Non remittitur peccatum niſi reſtituatur ablatum,</hi> and that before God or men. If a theefe rob me of my purſe, and then ſay he is ſorry for my loſs, and that he hath ſo injur'd me, yet will not reſtore my purſe to mee; Is his ſaying I repent, a probable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of his mind? Is that a credible profeſſion? St <hi>John</hi> ſhewes, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.17. compared with <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.20. <hi>If a man ſay he love God, or his neighbour,</hi> and yet ſo manifeſt his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, that he will not relieve his brother in diſtreſſe, he <hi>is a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar;</hi> and therefore ſo muſt be judged of, by that manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his deeds contrary to his words. Was not the enmity of the <hi>Jewes</hi> Adverſaries as to <hi>building the Temple,</hi> ſignified by their practiſing againſt the ſame, more then their friendſhip was by their good words, <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.2. <hi>Let us build with you, for we ſeeke your God as ye doe,</hi> &amp;c. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.8, 9. <hi>How do ye ſay ye are wiſe — they have rejected the word of the Lord, and what wiſdome is in them.</hi> 1 John 2.4. <hi>He that ſaith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments, is a lyar, and the truth is not in him.</hi> 1 John 1.6. <hi>If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him, and walke in darkneſſe, we lye and doe not the truth.</hi> Now ſure a <hi>lye</hi> manifeſted to be ſo, is not credible, nor a ſignificative te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of what in words is aſſerted. When the Pythoniſſe maide, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.16, 17, 18. gave teſtimony to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Sylas</hi> verbally, ſaying, <hi>Theſe men are the ſervants of the moſt high God, which ſhew unto us the way of ſalvation:</hi> Was that a credible profeſſion or teſtimony? <hi>Auguſtine libro de Mendacio ad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentium,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ille mentitur, qui aliud habet in animo, &amp; aliud verbis, vel</hi> quibuſlibet ſignificationibus <hi>ennnciat.</hi>

Was not <hi>Judas</hi> his betraying <hi>Chriſt</hi> into the hands of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> a more credible ſignifier of his treaſon, then his good words <hi>[haile Maſter]</hi> at the ſame time was of his duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſubmiſſion?

If ſome deeds of wickedneſſe committed after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of godlineſs, do evince that profeſſion to have been falſe, and ſo now not credible: then ſome deeds of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs committed and viſibly continued in at the time of the ſaid profeſſion, do much more invalidate it, and render it non-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibly ſignificative of the mind of the ſpeaker.

                  <p>But I am of opinion, if they ſhould ſo abuſe him, he would tell them (as well he might) that their word-payment ſtands for nothing, when contradicted by their non-payment in deed; he would not take their being <hi>poſitively</hi> his pay-maſters ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to engage him, whiles they are <hi>negatively</hi> no pay-maſters to him; if I may ſo uſe the diſtinction he layes ſo much weight upon, in this Controverſie of <hi>poſitively believers,</hi> which ſhould enright them to the Sacraments, though they are <hi>nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively unbelievers,</hi> that is, engaged to believe, though they do not.</p>

                  <p>ANother Reaſon my paper added at numb. 46. which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſets down, <hi>p.</hi> 108. and it was thus: Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, if the deed-rejecting of Chriſt were not of as certain credible ſignification concerning a perſons unbelief, as the word-rejecting is; then no perſon who denies not Chriſt in words, may be fully excommunicated; eſpecially if he deſire to communicate, and that earneſtly: which theſe men ſay is a teſtimony of his ſeriouſneſs, which we may not refuſe in his profeſſion to believe. And doubtleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— the reſt ſee at numb. 47, 48. This Mr <hi>W.</hi> deſignes to anſwer and confute, <hi>p.</hi> 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116. In all which, if neither vain confidence (his <hi>primum, ſecundum</hi> and <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi>) nor calumniating falſhoods, nor impertinent digreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may ſerve for reaſons againſt me, I doubt not my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent argumentation will remain ſafe enough for ought Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath to produce againſt it. Indeed if a Diſputation were to be managed in the <hi>paſsionate mood,</hi> and the <hi>Crab'd Figure,</hi> (ſuch as the Pythagoreans accounted the number 2.) he is hard enough for any man I know, (unleſſe the Quakers might go neer to match him.) I muſt confeſs I dare not vie ſcoffs (Iro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's I can digeſt well enough) nor foul language nor falſhoods with him. If this be the victory he ſeeks, he may take it for me. But it may be the Reader who hath not ſeen his Book, will hardly believe ſo many pages ſhould be blotted with ſuch ſtuff; but will expect I ſhould give him a more particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them. I am ſorry ſo to ſpend time, yet if it will not be helpt, I muſt be content, and he alſo.</p>
                  <p>(1.

Here's no convincing new evidence, that any wayes diſproves our poſition. The imbecillity of all your Allegations againſt us, and the miſerable ſhifts you are put to in colouring ever your own, confirm us the more ſtrongly in what we hold,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170420:101"/>and against what you pretend to. And the longer you argue, the more apparently do we ſee your imbecillity, and the goodneſſe of our own cauſe.</hi>

                  <p>Oh expedite and cleaver confutation! But Reader, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid he ſuſpects thou wilt ſcarce believe his tale once told, that he tells it thee ſo many times over, and that altogether too. But look back and ſee whether this reaſon of mine he aſſaults, was at all mentioned, much leſſe anſwered before in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; thy two eyes will give thee better information herein, than his tale twice two times told.</p>

In the next place he ſaith, <hi>You know we are not againſt the excommunicating of ſcandalous notorious and ſtubborn delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents — but before ſuch excommunication we maintain their externall right unto the Lords Supper, and their right of free acceſſe thereunto. And a Ministers admiſsion of them is not conſiderable in the preſent caſe. They come not thereunto upon his courteſie (as if he had power to admit or not admit). This is extrinſecal to the matter in hand. But they come upon their own proper and internal right,</hi> i. e. <hi>their baptiſmal interest as Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to perform viſible homage to their Lord and Saviour. And he that debars them as long as they are in viſible communion with Christians in other ordinances of equal ſanctity, is injurious to God and to them alſo!</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. Reader, ſuppoſe all this true, and ſee whether it wound my Reaſon he is anſwering. Will it hence follow, that <hi>ſome deeds of wickedneſs are not as ſignificative of a perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting Christ, as words are,</hi> (which was the propoſition by me to be proved,) or that if <hi>this were not ſo, no man who in words did not renounce Chriſt, might be fully excommunicated?</hi> (which was my Reaſon to prove the foreſaid propoſition by.)</p>
                  <p n="20">20 To the things he mentions, though impertinent to this place, I ſhall alſo make ſome reply. 1. Though mine Antagoniſts do not ſimply deny excommunication, yet they (ſome of them at leaſt) ſo lay their train, as to deny excommunication among us in <hi>England</hi> in theſe times. For they quarrell with any power claiming to manage it. <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Independent power</hi> will not ſure be allowed by them; and <hi>Claſsical Presbyterial power</hi> is the object of their ſcorns and contempt. And unleſs we could have Biſhops again, and thoſe aſſiſted by the State, I ſee not how they would allow of excommunication here in <hi>England.</hi> In <hi>England,</hi> I ſay,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170420:101"/>For I hope to the reformed Churches beyond Seas they will be more favourable than to deny them the uſe of Church cenſures for want of Prelates. But if they are impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, and will take in them too, whoſe caſe (to ſay truth) dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers not from ours; then ſhall excommunication be owned by them in all Europe no where, or onely among the Papiſts, who ſtill have Prelates.

                  <p n="2">2. I hold alſo that after a perſon is regularly admitted to the participation of the Lords Supper (that is after a ſolemne perſonall owning of his baptiſmall engagements) he is not to be debarred the Lords Supper, before he fall under ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, <hi>viz.</hi> either <hi>jure</hi> or <hi>facto, leſs</hi> or <hi>greater.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. One while M. <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaks of their <hi>externall right to the Lords Supper,</hi> as if he aſſerted onely their external right.

Many may have right in the later ſenſe externally, or before the Church (i. e. <hi>Eccleſia judice</hi>) who have not right in the former ſenſe internally and properly.

                  <p n="4">4. If ſuch as we have ſpoken of, have no right to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and do viſibly ſo appear, I think the Miniſter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the admiſſion or debarring of them, if he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove himſelf a faithfull <hi>Steward of the divine Myſteries, &amp; that it lyes wholly in him</hi> where there is no governing Church, but
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170420:102"/>where there is, it lies on him <hi>joyntly with others</hi> inſtructed by the Church.</p>
                  <p>As for that paſſage (often before) of the Miniſters courtefie in admiſſion, it hath been once and again repelled as an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and wretched, impertinent and falſe inſinuation: he muſt admit according to the Rule preſcribed him by his maſter (to whom he muſt give account) without being ſwayed awry ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by baſe fear and paſſion, or partiall reſpects. I think <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was of this mind when in his 60. Homily <hi>ad Pop. Antioch. de ſumentibus indignè, &amp;c.</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Let no cruell un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull man approach, no impure one any way. Theſe things I would have ſpoken as well to you who communicate, as to you who miniſter — No ſmall puniſhment hangs over your head, if ye permit any to partake of this Table whom you know to be held with any wickedneſs, for his blood ſhall be required at your hands, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. Their baptiſmall engagement to celebrate the Lords Supper, doth not hinder their being juſtly debarred (in the caſe under conſideration) no more than a Heathen (who hears the Goſpel preached to him) his engagement to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, doth hinder his being juſtly debarred baptiſme for want of ſcrious profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, antecedently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to baptiſme (as all I think do grant.)

                  <p>I know no difficulty here, but that concerning receiving their children to baptiſm. But that I find not mentioned by Mr <hi>W.</hi> And if their children ſhould be debarred baptiſm, that is no argument againſt debarring them the Lords Supper; Its no good reaſon that nothing ſhould be done in a buſineſs, becauſe all is not done which ſome think (and ſuppoſe rightly) ſhould be done. So far we are ſatisfied that the parents being ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly wicked as aforeſaid, ſhould be debarred the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Whether alſo their children muſt be debarred baptiſm. is another thing to be enquired into. This Controverſie is weighty and large, and I ſhall not preſume to deſigne a juſt diſcuſſion of it here, yet may I not wholly omit it. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the baptizing of the children of both parents notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ungodly, and ſuſpended or excommunicate, I would briefly hint theſe few things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Some ſolve the difficulty, by ſaying, We receive their children to baptiſm on other accounts than on their right from their immediate parents, as Mr <hi>Drake</hi> anſwered Mr <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys</hi> on this point.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But by the immediate (though notoriouſly ungodly ſuſpended or excommunicate) parent, I humbly conceive a right is conveighed for the bapriſm of his infant. (Suppoſing that the parent deſire it; otherwiſe none can meddle with the dedicating of his Infant, which is <hi>parentum juris,</hi> at the parents diſpoſal.) For,</p>
               </div>
               <div n="5" type="section">
                  <head>§. 5.</head>
                  <p n="1">1. All Pedobaptiſts uſe this Argument, Church-members may be baptized. Some children are Church-members-. <hi>Ergo.</hi> And doubtleſs they underſtand their Major propoſition here of Church-members not ſinfully debarring themſelves. For a ſon of a believer, who hath not been baptized in infancy, though he be a Church-member, may when he is adult by his ſcandalous life, hinder himſelfe of receiving bapriſm, as well as one baptized may of the Lords Supper. Now the child of a notoriouſly ungodly, and ſuſpended or excommunicated pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is a Church-member, and doth not ſinfully hinder, or put a bar to his own baptiſm. That he is a Church-member is proved; If the parent be a Church-member, then ſo is the infant, (this conſequence I think none I have to deal with will deny). But that he is a Church-member ſtill hath been proved above, <hi>chap.</hi> 3. §. 6.</p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:170420:103"/>
                  <p>That this child doth not put a bar to his own baptiſm, I need not prove. Upon this ground I add,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The child is not to be puniſhed for the fathers ſin; which yet he were, if he ſhould not be baptized. 1. Admit the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent be viſibly a believer when his child is born, or rather when the child is begotten, according to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. (which is ſaid to deſcribe the childs <hi>birth-priviledge,</hi> as it is called, though it ſeems rather to be a <hi>generation-priviledge</hi>) and that he delay the baptizing his child a month (perhaps longer) and in the mean time he for ſome notorious wickedneſſe is ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or excommunicated. Certainly his infant had a right to baptiſm (at leaſt <hi>coram Eccleſia</hi>) and ſuppoſing the parent to have true grace (<hi>coram Deo</hi> too) after it was born, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be ſaid, that to deny it baptiſme is no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as not depriving it of any right it ever had: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the denying it baptiſme now, is to cut it off from what it had, and loſt not by its own default.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It will not I think be denied, that it is a priviledge and great mercy which the gracious providence of God hath diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto this infant, that it hath or had right to baptiſme. If it were onely the priviledge of the parent, that he might have his child baptized, it were more imaginable how his child might be debarred upon his forfeiture. But ſince it is a priviledge to the child, it cannot be debarred, but it muſt be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed as well as its parent and that for its parents perſonall miſcarriage. He himſelfe indeed may keep it from baptiſme; but as in that he ſins and doth it wrong, ſo ſhould they who refuſe to do their office for the baptizing of it, upon the parents defire.</p>

Of the firſt there is no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion I thinke. The latter propoſition is cleere in both its parts. 1. This child is holy by conſecration, and being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly devoted to God. For when the parent entred, or ſeemed to enter Covenant with God; as therein God tendered himſelfe his God, and <hi>the God of his, or his ſeed;</hi> So his reſtipulation was anſwerable thereunto. that he <hi>and his, his ſeed ſhould be the Lords people.</hi> Whether this parent was ſincere in this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting or no; he and his are engaged thereby; and ſo <hi>his ſeed is a ſeed holy by conſceration,</hi> and being rightly devoted to God, and the ſervice of Chriſt: and as he himſelfe is to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted really juſtified, or dealt with as ſuch, till he notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contradict his profeſſed engagements to Chriſts ſervice, (<hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17.) ſo alſo is his ſeed (which in devoting himſelfe he alſo devoted to God (<hi>Deut.</hi> 29.11, 12.) to be treated as holy ones, and as juſtified ones are to be dealt with, till that they by notorious diſobedience contradict the engagements which lye on them. And thus the children which ſome wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Jewes</hi> offered to Idols, God claimes as his in a ſpecial and peculiar ſenſe, as having been devoted to him, and his ſervice, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.20, 27. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.27.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. Although the learned and worthy Mr. <hi>Baxter in his third diſputation about Right to the Sacraments;</hi> aſſerts and copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly labours to defend <hi>that the Infants of notoriouſly ungodly parents have no right to Baptiſme,</hi> (In anſwering of whom, this controverſie might have its juſt diſquiſition, which it cannot be expected I ſhould undertake) yet in that ſame diſputation, <hi>p.</hi> 264, 265. he moſt reaſonably aſſerts; <hi>That all God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the free univerſal Covenant of grace, to our participation of his benefits, is our conſent. And children do conſent by thoſe, whoſe they are: For they that owe them, or whoſe they are, have the diſpoſall of them, and ſo of their wills interpretatively, and may among men make any Covenant for them. which is for their good (at least) and oblige them to a performance of conditions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now upon this ground I would propoſe it to conſideration, whether a notoriouſly ungodly parent, yea excommunicate, (who in words profeſſeth aſſent to the Chriſtian faith, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170420:104"/>knows what the Chriſtian faith is, as to the fundamentalls of it) may not juſtly and fairly be preſumed by the Church and Miniſter, heartily to conſent to dedicate his child to God in Gods way, although he himſelfe is ſo bewitched with and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to his luſts, that he doth not conſent (as it appeares by his contradictory deeds) to give up himſelfe to God in his way; For my part I doe verily thinke, many a drunkard would have his child ſober and temperate; and many a wanton de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires his child may be chaſt, &amp;c. And in general many a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parent appears cordially to rejoyce in the towardlineſs and godlineſſe of his children, &amp;c. And then according to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid poſition of this accurate and pious Author, the child of ſuch a wicked parent <hi>may be admitted to enter,</hi> and therefore to ſeale his entrance into <hi>Covenant with God</hi> in Baptiſme; he conſenting underſtandingly for him upon Goſpel termes, <hi>whoſe he is,</hi> and in <hi>whoſe will the childes will is interpretatively invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Yet becauſe the ſcandalouſnes of the ſaid parent gives juſt occaſion to the Church of ſuſpition, feare and jealouſie, leaſt he ſhould alter his will and deſire now ſignified to have his child truly a Chriſtian and godly, and ſo faile in uſing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meanes for his childes inſtruction (during its non-age) in the Chriſtian faith; Its but equitable the Church ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand ſureties for the ſame; according to <hi>Ames</hi>

                  <p>I Shall now proceed to what remaines. (3) In the next place Mr. <hi>W.</hi> anſwers my forementioned Reaſon, to this purpoſe, <hi>p.</hi> 110, 111. <hi>If the man</hi> (ſuppoſed in the caſe) <hi>comes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to communicate,</hi> and that <hi>earneſtly,</hi> this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith is right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>affirmed (by mine Antagoniſts) to be a Testimony of his ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, which we may not, upon his profeſſion thereof, refuſe to beleeve.</hi> And this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> proves in theſe words; <hi>For, Sir, if you grant the caſe,</hi> viz. <hi>that he deſires to communicate, and that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly; then ſhew a Reaſon (if you can) why all godly minded Chriſtians ſhould not (in charity) believe (upon his profeſſion hereof) that this is to us</hi> (in foro externo) <hi>a credible testimony of his ſeriouſneſs? Nay, you adde moreover, that [who makes a credible ſerious profeſſion of his faith and willingneſs to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the Lord Jeſus Christ] the Church ought not to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. Nay, you adde [doubtleſſe the Church ought not]. And we adde, that [doubtleſſe] the Church ought not to deny ſuch an one the Lords Supper, or ſuſpend him from it. What a ſchiſme will do we know not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Reader may be pleaſed to beare in memory, that after I had evinced that a man baptized at yeares and not fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate, might be debarred the Sacrament, if at the time when he tenders himſelfe to be admitted (when the time
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170420:105"/>of celebration begins to draw neere) he in words renounce Chriſt, or an eſſential of Chriſtianity, (which is not (that I finde) denied by Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) In the procedure of my argument I added; that if ſuch word rejecting of Chriſt, as before-ſaid, may debar the perſon aforeſaid, then ſome deed-rejecting of Chriſt may alſo. Becauſe that by ſome deeds of wickedneſſe, there is as credibly a ſignification of a mans rejecting Chriſt, as in words. And this was proved as by other arguings, ſo by this under our hand at preſent, <hi>viz.</hi> If ſome deeds do not as credibly ſignifie a perſons rejecting of Chriſt, as words might doe; then none could be excommunicated for ſinfull deeds, whiles they renounce not Chriſt in words, but in words profeſs their earneſt deſire to be admitted to the Sacrament. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is valid, at leaſt <hi>ad hominem,</hi> becauſe mine Antagoniſts intimate, that he who verbally profeſſeth his deſire to receive, muſt be by us accounted a ſerious profeſſor of faith (what ever his works are.) And I averre that no viſibly ſerious profeſſor of faith is to be exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated. For then one in the way of a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exerciſe of faith and true repentance ſhould be excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; which none ſure will affirme. And this Conſequence I cannot ſee that Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſticks at. But now whereas I ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; <hi>But ſome may be excommunicated for ſinfull deeds, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that in words they renounce not Chriſt, but verbally profeſſe their carnest deſire to be admitted to the Sacrament.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I thinke Mr. <hi>W.</hi> denies; I am not certaine; look over his words thy ſelfe Reader, and uſe thine owne judgement to gueſs what he drives at. But this I am certaine of, either he denies this, or he ſaith nothing of a contradictory tendency to my argumentation which here he pretends to enervate. And if he do deny the foreſaid Aſſumption, as I conceive his words import taken together, It may be imputed to his haſt, that he ſhould hold what is ſo manifeſtly falſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That none may be excommunicated for ſinfull deeds, though never ſo hainous and notorious, if he renounce not Chriſt in words, and profeſſe verbally his earneſt deſire to communicate.</p>

                  <p>But becauſe M. <hi>W.</hi> bids me ſhew a Reaſon (if I can) for the contrary. I muſt prove that the Sun ſhines at noone day. And, 1. If this his aſſertion be true, then not profeſſing earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to communicate, in the only crime ſufficient to cauſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. But a man may be excommunicated for other wickedneſs, without reſpect to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. A whore mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170420:105"/>or drunkard, &amp;c. notoriouſly ſuch, may profeſs his earneſt deſire to receive, and yet that makes him not, no whoremonger, and no drunkard. 2. Then alſo, the Church may look for no further ſatisfaction in order to reſtoring of an excommunicate, then his verbal profeſſion of earneſt deſire to receive the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. For that which ſhould prevent their excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of him, muſt be avaylable to reſtore him. But the Church in many ages hath required particular confeſſion of notorious ſins, and expreſſe profeſſion of repentance for them, (and not only profeſſion of earneſt deſire to receive) as antecedently neceſſary to the abſolution of an excommunicate, in analogy to that, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.4, 5, 6. where he who was to bring his treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs offering for a falſe oath (though through ignorance) was to <hi>confeſſe that he had ſinned in that thing,</hi> and then he is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

For 1. here and in his book he confounds <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>duty,</hi> as if theſe were of the ſame latitude; as if becauſe its an heathens duty to be baptized, or a Chriſtians duty when drunk on the Lords day, to ſanctifie the Sabbath in publique Ordinances, yea or an Excommunicats duty to receive, (all which are manifeſtly their duty, which they are obliged to) that therefore it were the heathens right to be baptized, without any more adoe, or the drunken Chriſtians to be admitted into the Aſſembly while drunke, or the excommunicate had actual right to the Lord Supper, while excommunicate. 2.

                  <p>Here are learned arguments, apodictical demonſtrations, but be like all in <hi>Bocardo.</hi> Here are <hi>formulae oratoriae</hi> for the cupping crew, who may probably applaud the Author, and quaffe his health round for them. I'le confeſſe they are not to be anſwered by me. <hi>Ego poenitere tanti non emam,</hi> (as <hi>Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes</hi> ſaid to the Corinthian <hi>Lais</hi>) I dare not anſwer accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this folly. No wonder if he crow over me, as <hi>wanting ſtomack,</hi> and not being ſtomackfull enough (<hi>p.</hi> 108, 118.) for ſuch doughty diſputings. He makes it appeare (though unmannerly) what a <hi>full ſtomack</hi> he hath, by his continuall cructations of ſuch putrid and aduſt choler. For after all this, he is rifting again in this very place, and afterward, as ſowrely as if he had had no vent before, and at laſt (<hi>p.</hi> 114.) brings up that crude calumny (which he for the once belcheth forth) to beſmear me with it, <hi>viz. the denying the Pope to be Antichriſt..</hi> I ſee its parlous to be neer a man in his caſting
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170420:107"/>fits, or that owing one a ſpite, hath the trick of the <hi>new organon ſalutis,</hi> and can with his <hi>provang</hi> unload his ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack at his pleaſure. And this he uſhers in with a <hi>parturiunt montes,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>you know my meaning.</hi> I know indeed what followes, and thence conclude, M. <hi>W.</hi> is content to be a <hi>Mouſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap,</hi> that my paper may ſeeme <hi>ridiculous.</hi> But if he remember the ſtory Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> hath out of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> it may leſſen his confidence of vanquiſhing the Mouſe he laughs at. <q>The ſtory is thus in Hiſtory of the world, <hi>p.</hi> 612. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Senacheribs</hi> great hoaſt which he had when he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Hezekia</hi> by <hi>Rabſheca,</hi> was intended againſt <hi>Aegypt;</hi> But a great multitude of feild mice entring the Camp of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib</hi> by night, did ſo gnaw the bowes, quivers, ſtrings and ſtraps of his mens armour, that they were faine the next day to fly away in all haſt, finding themſelves diſarmed. In memory whereof (ſaith <hi>Herodotus</hi>) the ſtatue of this King is ſet up in the Temple of <hi>Vulcan,</hi> holding a mouſe in his hand, with this Inſcription, <hi>Let him who beholds mee ſerve God.</hi>
                     </q> I'le not apply the particulars, but only thus; <hi>The mouſe Mr.</hi> W. <hi>deſpiſeth, if it may have faire play (I doubt not) will diſarme this warriour, and cut in ſunder the nerves of his arguments.</hi> But the <hi>[parturiunt montes]</hi> I thinke may be more fitly applyed to his <hi>

And let the world (at his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and deſire) behold how he travaileth with iniquity, hath conceived miſchiefe, and brought forth falſhood. But this filth I ſhall wipe off beneath. For I am afraid of diſpleaſing the Reader, by having too much of theſe perſonal fooleries toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I ſhall therefore leave them, and ſpeak only to the thing remaining, which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath here touched upon, namely, concerning the <hi>deſcription of Excommunication</hi> (which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to gather out of ſome expreſſions of mine) <hi>to be a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a perſon to be as an heathen, and ſo to be dealt with.</hi>

He that is to be to us an heathen, is to be judged as an heathen, and ſo to be dealt with, that is, in ſome reſpects; <hi>viz.</hi> in thoſe wherein he is to be to us as an heathen. Neither the Scripture, nor my paper here ſaid <hi>he was to be judged</hi> an <hi>heathen</hi> ſimply.

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170420:107"/>of expreſſion my <hi>ſcriblings</hi> (as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> fitly calls them) did wholly comply. And what now hath our learned Gentleman to oppoſe hereunto? that you may ſeeke for ſome where elſe; unleſſe this may be allowed the place and honour of an obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in ſtead of a better, which skulkes in an implicit Ambuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cado, namely, the interpretation he puts on my expreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid; <hi>that is</hi> (ſaith our learned Expoſitor) <hi>to be counted as an enemy, and not to be admoniſhed as a brother.</hi> But if <hi>Paul</hi> be not againſt his Maſter, this will do us no hurt.

(<hi>Eph.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>&amp;</hi> 10.36. <hi>Mark</hi> 12.33.) And a Chriſtian excommunicate ought to be admoniſhed, though in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects he is to be to us as an Heathen. The reconciliation is eaſie.

If it be granted that one, though formerly baptized, and yet not fully excommunicated, yet now being an openly by word profeſſed Infidel, may be ſuſpended in any caſe, where there is a bar againſt his then full excommunication, then, at leaſt in the like caſe ſome ſcandalous livers in the Church
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170420:108"/>may be ſuſpended; and then I concluded with ſome paſſages of <hi>Salvian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus: I remember I have read ſomwhere in <hi>Salvian, qui Christiani nominis opus non agit, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus non eſſe videatur.</hi> And <hi>Infidelis ſit neceſſe eſt qui fidei commiſſa non ſervat.</hi> Agreeable whereunto is what I find quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from <hi>Tertullian Apol. cap.</hi> 44. ſpeaking of the Heathens priſons he ſaith, <hi>Nemo illic Chriſtianus niſi planè tantum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianus, aut ſi &amp; aliud jam non Chriſtianus.</hi>

                  <p>To this ſhort repetition of mine argument, Mr <hi>W.</hi> ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly rambles one continued long chide in nine pages (oh the Art of that man!) without bringing any thing new which hath a colour of reaſonable oppoſition to it; or old which hath not been already anſwered by me.

                  <p>But now at the middle of the 125 page he begins to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe more ſoberly, and ſo holds on too for divers leaves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And in earneſt, I would not have him miſſe the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders juſt commendation for it. It is not ſo ordinary (for ought I ſee) with him ſo to do, as that it ſhould not now be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obſerved to his praiſe. And therefore though it looks nothing like a <hi>Refutation</hi> of the ſum of the argument he ſhould be dealing with, I ſhall the more willingly touch (but briefly) the main contents thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He ſhewes the excellency of the Lords Supper, as in other reſpects, ſo for the <hi>ocular inſtruction of the meanest, and as an effectual means to convince men, and take them off from groſſeſt ſins,</hi> p. 125, 126.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe in this he aimes at that trite argument againſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, that the <hi>Lords Supper is a converting Ordinance.</hi> And I grant it may be ſo, and hath a probable aptitude as a means (taking the whole celebration together) to convert, even an heathen (or unbaptized Catechumen) who hath ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity before, if he ſhould (though ſinfully as all grant) be admitted thereunto. No one can ſay he ſhall not be converted thereby. But what's that to the purpoſe? If Gods revealed inſtitution deſign it not to the notoriouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, no more than to them, or ſuch as are fully excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate? We muſt not be wiſer than God, nor invent means of good to others unwarrantably, we may not do evill that the greateſt good may come thereby. Yet becauſe it muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that there will be cloſe hypocrites in the Church, who yet have an improper collaterall right to the Sacrament, in that Miniſters may rightfully miniſter unto them (though they have no proper right directly to the Sacrament.) God in his infinite wiſdome and goodneſſe hath ſo ordered it, that it may be hopefully uſefull for their converſion to ſincerity, and therefore ſo it may be deſigned by the miniſtrator, upon that ſuppoſition aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhewes (and rightly) how the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.14, 15, 16, 17, 21. to take off the Corinthians from Idolatry, alledgeth their uſe of the Lords Supper,— ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ye cannot <hi>partake of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Divels: he doth not herein, and for their evill diſcharge them from
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170420:109"/>the Lords Supper, but convinceth their reaſon of the inconſiſtencie of ſuch criminal liberty with the uſe of the Lords Supper.</hi> And here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is pleaſed to honour the Apoſtle with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending him for a <hi>Rational Churchman,</hi> p. 127.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. And then he ſhewes (and rightly too) that the Apoſtle his ſpeech, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.28. commands all Church-members a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dult to receive. — And <hi>p.</hi> 128. anſwering the objection, that all cannot examine themſelves, ſaith, <hi>That ſuch perſons are bound in conſcience, immediatly to labour for knowledge, and to break off their prophane courſes, that they may be able to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine themſelves, and to come to the Lords Table. But in the mean while their ignorance and prophaneſſe takes not off the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine obligation that lies on their conſciences.</hi> And this he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably inſiſts upon, <hi>p.</hi> 128, 129. But at the later end, as if he had wounded our cauſe to the quick (though alas! he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver toucheth it) he adds, <hi>And thus you ſee what the convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the double obligation will work men unto, if purſued and followed rigorouſly. A thing that lies on the Miniſters of the Goſpel to do, and not to caſt off the people by a childiſh or chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ſuſpenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then he ſhews how <hi>by baptiſme Christians are under this double obligation to examine themſelves and to come to the Lords Table, deny it</hi> (ſaith he with vehemency) <hi>who will, or can.</hi> When alas! I deny it not, nor doth the defence of my <hi>hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> require I ſhould. There are ſome other paſſages of his mixt with theſe I have related, I cannot digeſt, which have been anſwered elſewhere; and I am not willing to quarrell with them here, as long as the main of his diſcourſe hereon, ſeems ſuch as I do comply with. I will not compare with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> nor any other in rigorous preſſing of doctrines, this in ſpeciall for mens conviction and reformation. But I do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour it according to my poor meaſure; and I think here's nothing for ſubſtance of theſe things, which hath not been heard from me. But the knot lies not here, whether they are obliged <hi>both to labour</hi> for knowledge, and leave prophaneſſe, &amp; <hi>ſo to come?</hi> But in this, whether they may not be debarred the later, for their viſible want of the former? And he may be pleaſed to remember, that the <hi>Fallacia diviſionis,</hi> is as ill <hi>Logick</hi> as the <hi>Fallacia compoſitionis,</hi> to argue <hi>à bene conjunct is ad malè diviſa,</hi> is as conſequent, as <hi>à bene diviſis ad malè con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncta,</hi> which he minds us of, <hi>p.</hi> 128. and I have explained
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170420:110"/>my ſelf on this point before, <hi>ch.</hi> 10. §. 1, 2. and elſewhere. I ſhewed that obligation to duty doth not ever give or argue a right of admiſſion to the performance thereof ſimply, without any more a-doe. A drunken Chriſtian is not diſobliged from the publick ſervice of God while ſuch, nor doth any excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication diſoblige from the Lords Supper; they both ſin, in both not waiting on God in his ordinances, and hindring themſelves by their own default. That <hi>divers things debar from the performance of duties, which do not excuſe nor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige from them,</hi> is a truth ſo plain, that he that runs may read it.</p>

                  <p>THere is nothing further to exerciſe thy patience (good Reader) but ſome deſcants on the paſſages I quoted from <hi>Salvian</hi> and <hi>Tertullian.</hi> And firſt againſt thoſe of <hi>Salvian,</hi> Mr <hi>W.</hi> hath divers <hi>Exceptions,</hi> as 1, that I tell him not where in <hi>Salvian</hi> to find them. 2. That I quote a broken piece, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing what follows, adding <hi>an &amp;c. as a veil under which to hide his ſenſe.</hi> 3. That I quoting two paſſages in ſeverall books, put them together, which he ſaith is not fair dealing, <hi>p.</hi> 134. 4. And laſtly, that the thing quoted is perverted to a ſenſe not intended by the Author.—To theſe his Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I return, 1. to the firſt. When I finiſhed that <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi> paper he hath <hi>publickly</hi> aſſaulted, I had not my <hi>Salvian</hi> with me, elſe it had been eaſie to have turned to the Book and page. Every private paper needs not the exactneſſe (in theſe things) of a publick plea. Doth Mr <hi>W.</hi> in every Sermon or Lecture, when he quotes any paſſage from an Author, name the Chapter, Book and page? If he do, I think it is a needleſſe exactneſſe; when as any one who doubts of, or peruſeth the quotation, may eaſily have recourſe to him, for the place where it is to be found.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. His ſecond exception is frivolous, unleſs the words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing thoſe I quoted, did turn the ſenſe of the former word:
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170420:111"/>to another intent than that was for which I quoted them; which they do not, but rather confirm it, as ſhall be ſhewed in anſwering his ſourth exception.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The third exception is removed by what I have ſaid to his firſt, neither is <hi>Salvians</hi> ſenſe at all injured; he ſpeakes to the ſame purpoſe in both places, as ſhall appeare immediately. And I did not ſay they were joyned together in <hi>Salvian;</hi> but named them as two ſeverall paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, not quoting the book wherein either of them was to be read.</p>

I know no ſuch controverſie mentioned in <hi>Salvian</hi> as that is we are now diſcuſſing, to wit, about ſuſpenſion. What he intended or foreſaw the arguments and matter he treated upon might reach to, neither Mr. <hi>W.</hi> nor his reader can judge.

And now let the Reader judge (at mine as well as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his inſtance and deſire) whether my quotations were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent or no.</p>

Even <hi>ſo</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) <hi>men of the Christian profeſſion muſt act accordingly;</hi> they muſt and ſhould, but what if they do not? muſt not then the Chriſtian without exerciſing Chriſtianity, be accounted as the Phyſitian not verſed in <hi>Phyſick,</hi> or the Lawyer not imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe in the <hi>Law?</hi>
                  </p>

I ſhould have taken <hi>[Chriſtianus non eſſe videatur]</hi> to ſignifie he may ſeeme to be a Chriſtian; that is, he is no Chriſtian: <hi>videtur</hi> being uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an expletive word with <hi>Tully</hi> and other <hi>Latiniſts</hi> (according to the uſual Hebraiſme uſed in Scripture [to be called] is [to be] (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.6. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.32, 36. <hi>Math.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11.17.); and <hi>Salvian</hi> himſelfe having ſo expounded himſelfe in the point he ſpeakes to elſwhere, as we have ſeene. <hi>[Christiani eſſe dicuntur, &amp; non ſunt.]</hi> But as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> takes it, <hi>[he may not be ſeene by others nor himſelfe to be a Chriſtian],</hi> it well fits our turne, and is according to what <hi>Salvian</hi> hath, <hi>ad eccl. cathol. l.</hi> 2. <q>

                     </q> Doth not this reach to what I had ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That a deed-Teſtimony may prevaile above a word-Teſtimony? and therefore if we may debarre him who in words rejects Chriſt, then alſo him who by ſome notorious deeds of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, doth as manifeſtly reject Chriſt. Yea doth not M. <hi>W.</hi> ſay the ſame here in effect? Mr. <hi>W.</hi> before affirmed that we muſt certainly know thoſe are Chriſtians and beleevers whom we adminiſter to; and here he confeſſeth (in expounding <hi>Salvian</hi>) that a notorious ſcandalous profeſſor of Chriſtianity, who doth not the act and duty of a Chriſtian, <hi>cannot be ſeene of others to be a Chriſtian;</hi> how then will he adminiſter to him? he will ſay, (as I gueſſe) 1. <hi>he ſees him to be a word-profeſſor of Chriſtianity;</hi> that is, he ſees him to lye, and for his lyes ſake notoriouſly appearing to be ſuch, he will admit him.

                  <p>As for the diſcourſe Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here falls into about the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is betwixt a pagan Infidel unbaptized, and a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized unfaithful Chriſtian, <hi>p.</hi> 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144. It hath nothing in it which colourably makes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us (ſave two paſſages) which hath not been anſwered before; The deſcription of excommunication he would gather from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> viz. <hi>That it is a baniſhment of a Delinquent from communication of prayer, Aſſembly, and of all holy commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christians,</hi> hath been particularly ſpoken to, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. §. 10. One of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his pretentions which beares the ſhew of an objection is this, (<hi>p.</hi> 141, 142. where he ſaith,) <hi>In our Eccleſiaſtical diſcipline we proceed not againſt men, as no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as no beleevers, (therein you are miſtaken) For what have we to do to judge them that are without? We leave ſuch to Gods own immediate ſeverity and diſpoſal. In our diſcipline we proceed againſt men as Chriſtians, and as profeſſed beleevers, as within, as of ours, and of us, which have tranſgreſſed the law of faith, or violated the holy Rutes of Chriſtianity, and refuſe to ſubmit and make publique ſatisfaction when legally convented and convicted. Now if you judge and take our men (when you juridically ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend) to be no Chriſtians, no beleevers, not within, none of yours, nor of you, what talk you of either of ſuſpending or excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them? of no Chriſtians and no beleevers, they muſt be made Chriſtians and Beleevers by Baptiſme, not your examination and approbation of them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ground of this his objection hath been removed in the place laſt referred unto; and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. §. 6. (and <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. §. 5, 6.) where hath been acknowledged by us, that not only flagitious baptized perſons, but alſo excommunicates are Church-members, and therefore within, and ſo are not to be rebaptized when reſtored. In this the Reader may ſee whoſe way is more <hi>rigorous,</hi> Mr. <hi>Ws.</hi> or mine. His aſſociates take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicates for no Church-members, ſo do not I; and yet
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170420:114"/>they reſtore them not by baptiſme, when they alledge againſt mee, that <hi>ſuch as are not within, muſt be taken in by Baptiſme,</hi> as we heard Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſpeake. According therefore to what we have before delivered, we diſtinguiſh with Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and ſay; 1. Some perſons are, and are called Chriſtians, beleevers, &amp;c. only upon the account of their being poſitively and ſolemnly engaged to Chriſtianity, and the Chriſtian faith. And 2. ſome are, and are called Chriſtians and beleevers, not only on the account of their being ſo engaged as aforeſaid, but of their viſible conformity to thoſe Chriſtian engagements. All who are Chriſtians in the former reſpect, are Church-members, (whiles alive) and <hi>[within]</hi> in the Apoſtles ſenſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12. (that phraſe <hi>[of us]</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> inſerts too, if it referre to, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.19. is difficult to be underſtood, and its a great queſtion whether it be equipollent, to the [<hi>within,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.12.] ſo I ſhall omit it here). A diſciple or ſervant is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times denominated from his being entred into a School, having covenanted with his Maſter to ſerve him, and therefore theſe are lyable to Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures. And yet they may be no Chriſtians, nor beleevers viſibly, upon the account of the latter reſpect, and therefore cannot claime the priviledges belonging to diſciples who learne, and ſervants who obey their Maſters, whiles they notoriouſly refuſe to learne and obey Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this mindes me of the ſecond thing Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath in the fore-mentioned pages, which ſeemes to need an anſwer here. Its page 139. where he ſaith; <hi>A man undeniably without, and utterly uncapable of the Lords Supper, may have the Scripture characters of faith in your ſenſe,</hi> i. e. <hi>he may be inſtructed in the Chriſtian faith, be able to give an account (yea a true account) of his faith, ſubmit unto your Church order of examination, and be of Chriſtian behaviour without exception in his private carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and yet be ſuch a viſible unbeleever (to us) as the Lord in his word would not have the Lords Supper administred unto.</hi>— viz. <hi>becauſe not baptized,</hi> &amp;c. yea <hi>though</hi> as he before ſaid, <hi>he may be regenerated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sometimes Mr. <hi>W.</hi> makes <hi>to be within,</hi> and to be <hi>a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or beleever</hi> of equal latitude; as in his laſt exception, I have anſwered. Here he acknowledgeth one not <hi>within,</hi> to be a true and reall beleever; and therefore I ſhould conclude a true Chriſtian, though not ſo ſolemnly. For I am of opinion none can expect to be ſaved but true Chriſtians; and theſe Mr. <hi>W.</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:170420:114"/>ſaith, may be truly regenerate and goe to heaven. 2. But whereas he tells us this <hi>catechumen</hi> or <hi>heathen Proſelyte</hi> may be, without exception, of Chriſtian behaviour, in his private car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and yet not be capable of the Lords Supper. I utterly deny this. For if he were of Chriſtian behaviour, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, he would ſubmit to Baptiſme (the contempt whereof all acknowledge to be a damning ſin,) and then in the ſame day (and houre for ought I know) he might communicate. And if he have opportunity to deſire the Communion, he hath opportunity to be baptized, and therefore cannot be excuſed in the neglect of it, nor then be accounted in that neglect <hi>a beleever in reſpect of viſible complyance with and obedience to the Goſpel.</hi> Who only hath a viſible right to the Lords Supper. <hi>And now Sir</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>W.</hi> p. 145.) <hi>to your Allegation out of Tertullian,</hi> viz. [<hi>Nemo illic Chriſtianus,</hi> &amp;c.].</p>
                  <p>This alſo was quoted by mee, for the ſame purpoſe as the paſſages of <hi>Salvian</hi> were, <hi>viz.</hi> that the name or word profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity is no argument nor teſtimony he is a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, whoſe deeds do notoriouſly contradict the ſame. And my paper they expreſſed it (at <hi>numb.</hi> 50.) [Agreeable whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is what I finde quoted from <hi>Tertullian, Apolog. cap.</hi> 44. ſpeaking of the Heathens priſons; <hi>Nemo illic Chriſtianus niſi planè tantum Chriſtianus, aut ſi &amp; aliud jam non Chriſtianus.</hi>] Now Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath left out the word [priſons] in the copy he hath printed as mine, and when he hath ſo done, takes paines from the context in <hi>Tertullian</hi> to informe mee, that the Father ſpeakes of the Chriſtians ſufferings <hi>in priſons;</hi> as if I had not underſtood it before. Is not this a brave confutation to be boaſted of? He excuſeth his Tranſcriber of my paper, <hi>p.</hi> 115. And whether he muſt take this non-ſenſe to himſelfe he hath printed as mine, or on whom elſe he will lay it, I know not; I liſt not to upbraid him with <hi>frauds, impoſture,</hi> and <hi>cheating,</hi> &amp;c. which yet he uſually puts on mee, ſo wonderful civil and well manner'd is hee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170420:115"/>I returne you thankes for this plaine declaration of your minde in this peice of yours.</hi>) But (by <hi>his favour</hi>) he is too haſty in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding I had not peruſed <hi>Tertullian</hi> my ſelfe (and the ſame may be ſaid of his cenſuring my <hi>childiſhneſſe</hi> for referring to divers Authors as mentioned by <hi>Zepperus</hi>) becauſe I ſaid <hi>[I finde Tertullian thus quoted]</hi> there being other cauſes of ſuch references, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. When we have peruſed Authors, not now with us, and ſo the reference at ſecond hand helps us only to the place where that is, which we would quote. And 2. When the reference to ſuch later learned Writers who have quoted thoſe Authors for the ſame intents as we would make uſe of them, doth adde weight to the quotation, by affording a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable proofe, that the paſſages quoted are rightly underſtood and interpreted to the true and genuine ſenſe of the original Authors.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.

May not the ſame counſell be given in reading others of the

All my buſineſſe remaining here is to ſhew that the paſſages quoted from <hi>Tertullian</hi> are not accounted erroneous; That they cannot be reduced to <hi>Montaniſme,</hi> nor <hi>Tertullia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> I thinke is manifeſt already, to which yet Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſhould ſeeme to have reſpect in his mentioning them here, for the diſparagement of <hi>Tertullians</hi> authority.

               </p>
               <p>Concerning this (which is called) <hi>Examination,</hi> (that is, a taking cognizance of adult perſons, their underſtanding own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith, which in infancy they were baptized into) in order to their admiſſion to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion: I ſhal deliver my apprehenſions in the enſuing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p n="1">(1) I conſider, that the Scripture mentions not any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of ſuch who having been baptized infants, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when adult admitted to the Supper, as expreſsly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from them who were baptized adult, or at yeares: nor doth it, in expreſſe Rules or patternes deſcribe how or in what manner, ſuch baptized in infancy, were admitted, or are to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) Yet from what the Scripture informes us in, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prerequiſits in the adult to Baptiſme, and the nature of the Lords Supper in it ſelfe: Some Directions may be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red concerning this matter; particularly, That there may be required from perſons when they firſt tender themſelves to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that they make a ſerious profeſſion of their aſſent and conſent to the Chriſtian faith, they have been baptized into. (Whether this be by a continued ſpeech, or catechiſtically, is not at all ſtood upon.)</p>
               <p>For 1. There is the ſame Reaſon for requiring this here, as there is for (that which none deny) the requiring it from perſons adult in order to their Baptiſme; although they be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo learned and regular in their converſations before: As
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170420:118"/>
                  <hi>Auguſtine, Ambroſe,</hi> and others have been; and ſuch as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> acknowledgeth, (<hi>p.</hi> 139.) were in a ſalvable condition) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their baptiſme, and therefore did viſibly appeare ſo to be. The viſible underſtanding owning of the Covenant, whereof the Sacraments are ſeales, is as requiſite in the firſt admiſſion of the former to the Lords Supper, as in the latter to Baptiſme; all things being equall on both parties, ſave only that one is baptized, not the other: but this alters not the thing in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; becauſe his being baptized in infancy, is no teſtimony of his perſonal or viſible owning the Covenant, which is required in the adult for the participating of the Lords Supper. 2. There is no Rule (I know of) to direct us at what yeares any one baptized in infancy, may be admitted to the Communion, but according to his ſooner or latter underſtanding profeſſion of his baptiſmal engagements. Why may not a child of ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven yeares old be admitted (who may be taught to repeat a Catechiſme, and to ſay he deſires to communicate) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not then judged in a capacity underſtandingly to conſent to the Covenant termes? And how can another though of twenty yeares be judged underſtandingly to own the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, who doth not ſo profeſs the ſame before ſufficient wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes? For <hi>de non existentibus &amp; non apparentibus idem est ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium.</hi> Therefore this verbal profeſſion may be required to be made by a perſon adult (baptized in infancy) in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of competent witneſſes, before he is admitted to the Lords Supper. 3. Mr. <hi>W.</hi> himſelfe tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 56. that <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of [who are beleevers] and of [who are not beleevers] muſt be the loadſtar of our adminiſtring or not administring the Lords Supper.</hi> And <hi>p.</hi> 59. he ſaith, <hi>In our adminiſtration of the Lords Supper to others, we are to be guided by the Scripture Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a doctrinal faith. And of this we may have infallible certainty, when we know the parties are baptized, and heare them ſay the Creed, and testifie their beleeſe of every Article therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. And hence we connclude infallibly, that they are</hi> (he ſhould have ſaid viſibly appeare to be) <hi>of a right faith, and doctrinally true beleevers.</hi> And againe, ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi> 61. <hi>By our adminiſtration to beleevers, is meant ſuch beleevers, as we may have a certainty that they are beleevers.</hi> Now if we muſt know them to be beleevers by hearing them ſay the Creed, and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying their beleefe of every Article therein, before we can have a certainty they are beleevers capable of admiſſion to the Supper; then they muſt give an underſtanding (viſible) ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170420:119"/>of their faith, in order to their admiſſion. Their having been baptized in infancy is no demonſtration (and leſs then demonſtration will not ſerve for the infallible certainty Mr. <hi>W.</hi> requires) of their perſonall doctrinal faith: this doctrinal faith they cannot be expected to have without inſtruction preceding: and the meanes of inſtruction afforded to them, is no proof of their proficiency; therefore according to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, they muſt give an account of their proficiency under the meanes of inſtruction they have had, for the attaining this indiſpenſably neceſſary doctrinal faith, (which we muſt, ſaith he, have an infallible certainty of) before we adminiſter unto them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſame Reaſon which will juſtifie the requiring a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents renewing his profeſſion of faith, and renouncing what is contrary thereunto, when he preſents his childe to baptiſme, will as effectually prove, that he ſhould perſonally profeſſe the faith, before he was admitted to the Lords Supper. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whereas an ancient Divine in this Country (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) at the celebration of a Baptiſme, having asked the Parent the uſuall Queſtions, then offered to his Brethren, <hi>Why that parent might not be admitted to the Lords Supper, without any further Examination before Miniſter or Elderſhip, ſince he had now made an open profeſſion of his faith at the baptiſme of his child?</hi> It may be anſwered. 1. That if he pleaſe to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to warrant his demanding that profeſſion from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, before the infant ſhould be baptized; the ſame will ſhew what he deſired. (He may try at his leaſure to give a Reaſon for the one, which will not as effectually reach the other). 2. Yea much more ſtrong will it be in the latter than former caſe; In his <hi>datum</hi> than <hi>quaeſitum;</hi> ſuppoſing the parent had been (upon a perſonall owning the Covenant engagements) admitted before that time to the Lords Supper. 3. I ſhould readily grant if this parent have not (or not upon a perſonal confeſſion of the faith) been admitted to the Lords Supper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this profeſſion he was occaſioned to make at the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme of his infant, may ſo far as it goes, ſerve without renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, at his admiſſion to the Lords Supper. But then it ſhould be conſidered, whether the anſwering in that forme, <hi>I beleeve, I renounce, for ſake,</hi> &amp;c. may be reaſonably judged an underſtanding owning of the Covenant, where it appeares not (by previous conference with him, or a preſent more full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of himſelfe, or ſome other probable way) that he
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170420:119"/>doth underſtand what he anſwers unto. 4. Laſtly, I anſwer, That the parent who is to be admitted to the Lords Supper, ought not only underſtandingly to own the Covenant and baptiſme as one ſeale thereof (which he makes profeſſion of at the baptiſme of his infant) but alſo particularly the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Lords Supper, the ſignification of the ſacramental elements and actions therein, and the end of celebrating the ſame, that he may be in a viſible capacity of diſcerning the Lords body; And therefore there is manifeſt reaſon why he ſhould make a further profeſſion (ſuppoſing he hath not done it before) for his own admiſſion to the Communion, then was required from him at the admiſſion of his Infant to baptiſme. And ſo much in anſwer to this propoſall of the Miniſter afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, of which I deſire his candid acceptance. Some other paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages mentioned by him at the ſame time I neglect, as ſavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of calumny and paſſion. The tide may turne, and the <hi>brooke</hi> therewith; I grudge him not the liberty of <hi>Retract on;</hi> but then it were ſeemly to be without <hi>detraction</hi> from others who ſtill own the opinion he was lately moſt zealous for. I now proceed.</p>
               <p n="3">(3) It makes no alteration as to the matter in hand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this underſtanding profeſſion of the faith, be immediately before a perſons firſt admiſſion to the Sacrament, or a longer time before, ſo that the thing be done. And therefore where <hi>Confirmation</hi> was in uſe, and ſeriouſly managed, that might ſerve this purpoſe ſufficiently; according to the direction of the Common prayer book, before recited, <hi>Ch:</hi> 4. §. 3.</p>
               <p n="4">(4) If perſons have been unduely admitted to the Lords Supper, without making this underſtanding profeſſion of the Chriſtian faith before; that excuſeth them not from being now called to make it, in order to their preſent admiſſion: this will ſtand good, till it can be evinced that a neglect excuſeth from duty; that that muſt never be done which hath been ſinfully left undone, and that becauſe of that irregular omiſſion; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though as fit an opportunity is againe afforded for the doing of it, as that was which formerly was not taken hold of (as it ſhould have been) for the ſame. And indeed, (as the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod of London</hi> in their <hi>Vindication</hi> hath obſerved) The great Odium caſt upon the Presbyterial way, is occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the ſhameful neglect formerly, of the Rules then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for Examination of all, before they ſhould have been admitted to the Lords Table: And now the Reformation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170420:120"/>in this thing, is not ſo much for the amending the Rule which before was preſcribed, as in calling people up to a ſtricter obſervation of the ſame Rule for matter and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="5">(5) It hath bin already ſhewed, that the <hi>Presbyterian Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which is that confirmed by the <hi>Parliament</hi> after advice had with the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> not what ſome Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans may hold) doth not require all perſons now ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine examined, who have formerly upon the due profeſſion of their faith, been admitted to the Sacrament; But it forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ignorant to be admitted, only inferres, that ſuch as hitherto have not underſtandingly owned the Covenant of grace, ſhould now be called to do it, if they would partake of the Sacrament. And therefore where any have formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that in ſubſtance which is now required from them who are to be firſt admitted to the Supper, and can make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, there is no neceſſity according to Presbyterian principles, for their rene wall of it, as to their preſent communicating.</p>
               <p n="6">(6) This profeſſion muſt be made before ſufficient and comperent witneſſes (elſe it cannot be a ſatisfactory profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on); But who thoſe muſt be, is a conſideration of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For this may vary according to the different circumſtances of perſons, times, and places, (and the judgement of the Church thereupon, or of thoſe who are moſt eminently concerned in the management of ſuch things pertaining to the prudential order thereof) ſo that the end be attained for the good of the perſons admitted, and the ſatisfaction and edification of the Church. I am informed, by a Manuſcript Copy I have of the <hi>Reſolves of a Provincial Synod held at Preſton in Lancaſhire, Novemb.</hi> 14. 1648. that the ſaid <hi>Synod</hi> among other things <hi>reſolved</hi> in their ſixt particular. <q>That there is not only one way preſcribed or warranted by the word of god, for the Elderſhips ſatisfying themſelves of the ſufficiency in point of knowledge of perſons that are members of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions reſpectively, that they may be admitted to the Lords Supper. 7. That it is not lawfull for the Elderſhips to tye themſelves to one way as aforeſaid, (ſuppoſe it be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation before them) when that one attaines not the end, and another may probably doe it.</q> So they.

                  <hi>a Juſtice of peace,</hi> or a Miniſter ſhall be preſent to take and record the ſignification of their conſent.

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170420:123"/>the Antichriſts of thoſe dayes, the falſe Chriſts, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. He is ſecondarily and by conſequence (even in <hi>Iohns</hi> ſenſe) the Antichriſt to whom thoſe Characters do ſecondarily and by conſequence agree; and this is the <hi>Man of Rome.</hi> (upon which I vindicated our Proteſtant Writers in their referring to <hi>Rome</hi> in their Commentaries on theſe Epiſtles; ſo far was I from claſhing with them.) And this man of <hi>Rome</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the Antichriſt of the latter times, directly deciphered, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. and in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> under the Titles of <hi>the Man of Sin, Whore of Babylon, &amp;c.</hi> though the holy Ghoſt doth never directly and in the primary ſenſe of any place where [Antichriſt] is mentioned in Scripture (it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never uſed but in the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Iohn</hi>) affix the ſame on them of <hi>Rome,</hi> but by conſequence onely.

               <p>Mr. <hi>W.</hi> tells us, <hi>p.</hi> 11, 12, of parties known to be Chriſtianly judicious, and of blameleſs behaviour, who yet purpoſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe our examination upon the account of our divine right; ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly diſcerning the way and deſign to be Browniſticall, and not Scriptural. <hi>And ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe laſt mentioned may judiciouſly refuſe, that they might not countenance ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. To whom are theſe parties known to be Chriſtianly ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious? If to all the Church-officers, I do not think they would debar them; if they do, I diſown their practice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And I know none who require them neceſſarily by divine right to renew the profeſſion of their faith in order to their communicating, who are already ſufficiently known to be (not onely judicious but) <hi>Christianly judicious,</hi> as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſpeaks.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And if any Church did ſo require it, none do engage
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170420:124"/>the parties ſpoken of to believe they muſt needs ſubmit on that account to this examination that they may be capable of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The word <hi>[Browniſticall]</hi> is often taken up to diſgrace the Presbyterian way, as it was formerly againſt the old Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans. If Mr. <hi>W.</hi> had that of <hi>a Man</hi> in him he finds deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated in me (<hi>p.</hi> 154.) he might have told his Reader of <hi>Browns</hi> opinions condemned (and then it would appear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Presbyterian Principles were guilty thereof) and not fight againſt us with the Rattles of meer names. But take theſe <hi>Clackes</hi> from him of <hi>[Brownists, Anabaptists, Mormoes, &amp;c.)</hi> and you half ſpoil him.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If Mr. <hi>W.</hi> can make that out, that the parties he ſpeaks of may lawfully ſeparate from our communions, becauſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination required (yea ſuppoſe amiſs:) I will undertake upon the ſame ground to evince that his people may judiciouſly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from his ſacramentall communion, leſt they ſhould countenance prophaneſſe. And if any do withdraw from him upon the later account, he may thank himſelf for giving them ſuch a weapon to defend themſelves againſt him with. But for my part, although I think the one as juſtifiable as the other, I muſt profeſs I juſtifie neither. I think this is a main thing of <hi>Browniſme</hi> and <hi>Donatiſme,</hi> to hold that we may lawfully ſeparate from the ordinances of God in Churches holding the fundamentals, becauſe of ſome (ſuppoſed) male-adminiſtrations therein, which we are not neceſſitated in our joyning with them to approve of. And yet this Mr. <hi>W.</hi> hath aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by clear conſequence, when he ſaid, that perſons may judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ſeparate from our communions, becauſe of a ſuppoſed miſcarriage in the Church-officers in requiring examination; who yet never require the perſons examined ſhould profeſſe their beliefe of the neceſſity <hi>jure divino,</hi> of the ſaid examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as a condition prerequiſite to their admiſſion. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> (the mall of the Denatiſts) <hi>contra Parmen. l.</hi> 3. gloſſing on thoſe words, 1 Cor. 5. <hi>[auſerte malum ex vobu]</hi> (whether in the ſtrict ſenſe of the place or no I now diſpute not) <q>

My return is as followes. 1. How far the Lords Supper is to be acknowledged a converting ordinance, I have before ſhewed, <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. §. 2. 2. But here Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would anſwer an objection he ſuppoſeth I ſhould make againſt him, by inferring <hi>that then Heathens ſhould be admitted.</hi> But I would not make that inference from the ſuppoſing the Sacrament were (in ſome ſenſe) a converting ordinance, no more then that an excommunicate ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. We muſt not adminiſter ordinances to any but thoſe the Lord hath warranted us to adminiſter unto, although we might conceive a probable aptitude in thoſe ordinances (as meanes) for the ſpirituall good of ſuch as are ſinfully admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittted thereunto. 3. Yet if I ſhould make that objection Mr. <hi>W.</hi> here puts upon me, it would (for ought I ſee) remaine in force for all he hath here brought for the ſolution of it. He tells us, 1. He is to be <hi>admitted in ſenſu diviſo, not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſito.</hi> But if the Lords Supper he deſigned and appointed to be uſed by us as much and primarily for converſion as preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, there appeares no reaſon in the nature of the ordinance it ſelfe (Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is treating of), why it ſhould not be diſpenſed to an heathen whiles an heathen, as well as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching is. 2. He abuſeth that Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. I hope I ſhall not wrong the Reader by inſerting a few words for the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170420:127"/>cleering of its meaning, whereby will appeare the abſurdneſs of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his application thereof.</p>
               <p>The propoſition the Apoſtle reſumes further to prove, is in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe; That <hi>both Jewes and Gentiles are all under ſia,</hi> and ſo liable (in themſelves without the grace of the Goſpel) to condemnation. And this he proves by ſundry Quotations out of the old Teſtament, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10, 11, &amp;c. to the end of <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. <hi>As it is written, There is none righteous, no not one,</hi> &amp;c.

And therefore the following words, <hi>ver.</hi> 19. which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> quotes, are not brought to ſhew that the Jewes only were under the precepts and prohibitions of the written Law. But the Apoſtle here makes a particular Application of thoſe quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which ſhewed the depravedneſſe of men in generall, to the Jewes in ſpecial; that they might not exempt themſelves, or thinke themſelves better by nature than the Gentiles: as they had been brought in pleading againſt the Apoſtle, in the beginning of the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, And <hi>now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we know, that whatſoever the Law ſaith,</hi> (the old Teſtament Scripture,) <hi>it ſaith to them that are under the Law.</hi> So we reade it; but the Original is <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170420:127"/>ſenſe the words, though with no advantage to Mr. <hi>W.</hi>) <hi>that what ever the Law ſaith, it ſpeakes of the Jewes to whom it was given.</hi> For it ſpeakes often of the Gentiles. But this is cleere, what it ſaith, it ſaith to them to whom it is made known, and therefore their mouthes, (together with the Gentiles) ſhould be ſtopped from pleading for juſtification, by their obedience to the Law, which none of them had perfectly obeyed.</p>
               <p>Now how can this text be applyed <hi>by proportion</hi> to inferre that the heathens muſt be baptized before they come under the commands of the Goſpel; as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> would have it, <hi>q. d.</hi> As the Jewes were particularly concerned to take notice of the corrupt nature of man, which made juſtification by workes to be impoſſible, either to Jewes or Gentiles, and to take notice of what ever the Law ſaith to (or of) them: So (what ſhall I ſay?) Heathens under the times of the New Teſtament are not obliged to receive the Lords Supper till they are baptized, and poſitively engaged to Chriſtianity. Where's the <hi>propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which Mr. <hi>W.</hi> is ſo confident of, that ſhould ſtop the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors mouth? Such a Rule of proportion as this ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be called the <hi>Leaden</hi> then <hi>Golden Rule.</hi> It may be a truth (though not gathered from this text) that Heathens to whom the Goſpel is not revealed, ſhall not be condemned for ſinning againſt the poſitive Rules of Chriſtianity. But if Chriſtianity be revealed to them, they are bound immediately to cloſe therewith; and ſo to be baptized and communicate, as oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity is offered. They are <hi>in the Goſpel</hi> now, according to the proportion of <gap reason="foreign">

But then what a wild poſition hath he given us to no purpoſe? When Chriſt gave Commiſſion to his Miniſters to <hi>diſciple all
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170420:128"/>nations,</hi> Gentiles as wel as Jewes, and then <hi>to baptize them;</hi> and <hi>to preach the Goſpel to every creature:</hi> muſt the ſcope of their Miniſtry be properly to bring them only to an external profeſſion of ſubmiſſion to the Goſpel, that they might receive Baptiſme, and not properly intend their ſaving converſion, till after they were baptized? I had thought the <hi>proper intent</hi> of the Goſpel miniſtration to the Heathens, when it was firſt preached to them, had been to convert them ſincerely, <hi>to turne them from darkneſſe to light,</hi> and <hi>from the power of Satan to God,</hi> to <hi>receive forgiveneſſe of ſins, and an inheritance among them who are ſanctified by faith in Christ,</hi> Act. 14.15. <hi>&amp;</hi> 26.18. and not <hi>properly</hi> firſt to make them hypocrites, only dogmatical profeſſors; reſerving the proper intent of the Goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration for their ſaving converſion, till after they were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
               <p>But if Mr. <hi>W.</hi> meane by <hi>[being under the Goſpel]</hi> ſuch as heare the Goſpel, then he ſaith true. The intent of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel miniſtration is to convert them who heare it, as Heathens doe, when it is firſt preached to them, as well as borne Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. But this is impertinent to the ſcope of Mr. <hi>W.</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent diſcourſe, and the pretended ſolution of the objection he is now dealing with.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall give a plaine but briefe Narrative of the tranſaction of this buſineſſe. I was ſundry times earneſtly ſolicited by a Miniſter (Mr. <hi>N.</hi>) to let him have an account of my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning ſuſpenſion, which he deſired on the behalfe of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> (the Gentleman Mr. <hi>W.</hi> mentioned) an endeared friend of the ſaid Miniſter. I told him I had nothing written about it, but ſome ſhort animadverſions I had long agoe made for my own uſe, upon Mr. <hi>Humphrey</hi> his firſt piece on this ſubject. Which upon entreaty I lent to him: and it ſhould ſeeme by what Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 115. they were communicated to the Gentleman aforeſaid, and without my knowledge to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Being againe and againe, importunately moved by the Miniſter aforeſaid, to ſtate the Queſtion, and give in my opinion thereon, more diſtinctly; I at laſt conſented to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour ſomewhat therein; the which I finiſhed at the houſe of the ſaid Miniſter, being occaſionally there one night. Upon his further deſiring that with my leave, this paper might be communicated to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> I permitted the ſame, if by the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman aforeſaid, it ſhould be thought fit; being certified that upon Mr. <hi>M.</hi> his repreſenting to his Miniſter Mr. <hi>W.</hi> how he was unſatisfied in the doctrine of the general admiſſion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for; Mr. <hi>W.</hi> for the ſatisfaction of his Pariſhioner had ſhewed himſelfe <hi>willing and deſirous</hi> to admit of a collation with ſome Miniſters of a different judgement from him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. (as I have to ſhew under the hand of Mr. <hi>M.</hi> the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man aforeſaid.)</p>
               <p>And indeed I was cordially deſirous to have the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie ſearch't into to the very bottome, as being of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and my ſelfe ſufficiently inclinable (if I know mine own heart) to receive any convictions Mr. <hi>W.</hi> might afford ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to ſway me to his part, as the moſt deſirable upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward accounts, if it could but appeare to be warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; which made me the more willing to conſent to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts aforeſaid. Now when this Paper of mine by <hi>Mr. M.</hi> was communicated to <hi>Mr. W. Mr. M.</hi> hath certified me under his hand. that <hi>Mr. W.</hi> (in ſtead of returning a private anſwer as was expected for a candid brotherly impartiall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the point) <q>
                     <hi>as if he had gotten ſome mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi>

               <p>Many other paſſages <hi>Mr. M.</hi> hath teſtified under his hand, but I ſhall omit inſerting the ſame here, in reſpect to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> whoſe diſparagement I ſeek not, to the Reader, to whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall matters I know will be tedious, and to the cauſe it ſelfe I defend, which needs not the infirmities of its oppoſers to raiſe it ſelfe by. When I had intimation of the reſolution for printing my paper, I ſaid I would not lift up my lip to deſire a forbearance: I think I could have been content to have ſeen my ſelf rationally confuted. But when I ſaw the anſwer, and how in ſtead of cloſe anſwering the argument before him, he did ſo pitifully extravagate, and ſo ſedulouſly ſeemed to endeavour the diſgrace of my perſon, rather than the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of my cauſe, I was much confirmed thereby in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion I had aſſerted. Let the equall Reader freely judge herein.</p>

               <p>It is not my buſineſs now to diſcuſs the Controverſie; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any perſons but Miniſters or preaching Presbyters may be choſen and deſigned by the Church, to joyn with the miniſters in the Eccleſiaſticall externall government thereof? If I ſhould ſpeak any thing concerning it (in this laſt Digreſſion) I ſhould premiſe a diſtinction to be put betwixt what is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in Scripture by divine inſtitution, and command for all Churches at all times to obſerve, and what is gatherable from Scripture precedents and paſſages, to have then been lawfully uſed in the Church of God, and therefore may ſtill lawfully be imitated. Of this later ſort are <hi>Lords-dayes, Collections,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1.2.

Of which ſort alſo I humbly conceive the Station of ſuch as are now called Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Elders, is to be accounted; not meerly ſo an excogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of prudence, as if it had no footſteps in Scripture paterns, nor yet ſo abſolutely by divine appointment, as that all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſin, who in any times have not made uſe of them. And this I take as a <hi>mean</hi> betwixt two extreams.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not ſo much as name the Arguments commonly produced for the Scripturalneſſe and Reaſonableneſſe of their Office. I ſhall onely crave leave to offer one Scripture, which is not ſo much taken notice of as I think it ſhould be for the clearing this point, (having before warned the Reader that it is not the name but thing I aim at.)</p>
               <p>Acts 15. The Synod there mentioned, wrote Decretall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, <hi>after this manner,</hi> v. 23. <hi>The Apoſtles, and Elders, and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſend greeting unto the Brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia, &amp;c.</hi> And then the Decree it ſelf is recorded in the following verſes. That which I would have here obſerved, relating to the point in hand, is, that ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Brethren,</hi> are joyned with the <hi>Elders,</hi> or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, from whence ariſeth this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If theſe</hi> (called) <hi>Brethren acted authoritatively in this Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall Decree, and yet were not privat Chriſtians, the Diſciples or Members of Jeruſalem Church; then ſome ſelect perſons, not Miniſters did act authoritatively in Eccleſiasticall government. But the former is true: Therefore the later.</hi> In the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of the <hi>Antecedent</hi> I ſee nothing likely to be denied. The <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> I ſhall endeavour to prove in its two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That theſe <hi>brethren acted authoritatively in this Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Decree,</hi> is evinced by many of theſe ſtrong Reaſons,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170420:130"/>whereby <hi>the Reverend Aſſembly</hi> (in their Anſwer to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Diſſenting Brethren, concerning Presbyterial Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, preſented to the <hi>Honourable Houſes of Parliament, p.</hi> 65.) do prove that the <hi>Elders</hi> did act authoritatively as well as the <hi>Apostles:</hi> the which are further improved by the <hi>London Miniſters</hi> in their <hi>Jus Divinum Reg: Eccleſiastici,</hi> p. 224. to evince that both <hi>the Elders and Brethren</hi> acted authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively as well as the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> 
                  <q>The <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſay the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters) who were as authoritatively members of the Synod as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> did in all points as authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively act as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> themſelves.</q>
               </p>
               <p>For 1. The letters containing the Synodical Decrees and Determinations, were written in the name of the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> as well as in the name of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> verſ. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> as well as the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> brand the falſe Teachers for troubling the Church, <hi>ſubverting of ſoules,</hi> declaring that they gave the falſe Teachers <hi>no ſuck Commandment</hi> to preach any ſuch doctrine, <hi>v.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> as well as the <hi>Apostles</hi> ſay, <hi>It ſeemed good to the holy Ghoſt, and to us,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi> as well as the <hi>Apoſtles did im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Churches no other burthen then theſe neceſſary things,</hi> v. 28.</p>
               <p>In all which its manifeſt the proof is as ſtrong for the joynt authoritative acting of the <hi>Brethren</hi> here, as it is for the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders.</hi> I ſpeak of a joynt act in the ſame <hi>kinde of power:</hi> how farre the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> might excell the <hi>Elders,</hi> or the <hi>Elders</hi> the <hi>Brethren</hi> in the <hi>degree of power</hi> in each reſpectively, is not now enquired for.</p>
               <p>All (I can thinke of) which may be objected againſt this proof is;</p>
               <p n="1">(1) That in divers places the Authors of this ſynodical Decree are mentioned under the name of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> without joyning the <hi>Brethren</hi> with them. As, 1. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochian Delegates are in their Inſtructions directed to make their addreſs to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> about their Queſtion, <hi>v.</hi> 2. And 2. the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders</hi> came together to conſider of this matter, <hi>v.</hi> 6. And 3. the <hi>Decrees</hi> of this <hi>Synod</hi> are ſaid to be ſuch as were ordained by the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders,</hi> which were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 16.4.</p>
               <p n="2">(2) That the <hi>Brethren</hi> may be named here, no otherwiſe then as in <hi>Pauls Epiſtles Timothy,</hi> or <hi>Soſthenes,</hi> and ſometimes
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170420:130"/>all the <hi>Brethren with him,</hi> are; which denotes only their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting thereunto.</p>
               <p>To the firſt of theſe I anſwer. 1. That its ordinary to name the whole from the predominant, leading &amp; more noble part. 2. Theſe Scriptures do not ſay, the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Elders only,</hi> excluding others were Authours of this Synodical Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and therefore they are no prejudice to thoſe other Texts, which put in the <hi>Brethren</hi> with them.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond, I ſay, Though <hi>Paul</hi> joyne others with him in his Epiſtles ſometimes, yet, 1. the title of thoſe Epiſtles beare his name only. 2. He manifeſts in the Epiſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are his only, ſpeaking in the firſt perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1, 2, 6, 9, 10, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The ſalutation of me Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every Epiſtle, ſo I write.</hi> 3. If we had no ſuch cleere Reaſons elſwhere to prove <hi>Paul</hi> only the Authour (under the Holy Ghoſt) of ſuch Epiſtles, the joyning others with him in the Preface would be a ſufficient ground of our taking them who are ſo mentioned in the Preface, to have been joynt Authours with him thereof. But now here's nothing can be ſhewed to invalidate the title of the Synodicall Decree, in its ſtricteſt ſenſe. <hi>Act.</hi> 15.23. 2. The Decree ſpeakes all along in their names which are prefixed thereunto. 3. <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Lawes</hi> ſpeake moſt ſtrictly and properly; eſpecially in the Titles and Prefaces thereof, which declare the power whereby they are made and promulgated (as a Law made by Kings, Lords, and Commons:) Although in familiar Epiſtles, there's ordinarily more liberty of a larger expreſſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The latter part of the <hi>Minor</hi> propoſition, in the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am upon, is this, <hi>viz. That theſe Brethren were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Christians, the Diſciples or Members of the Jeruſalem Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This (I beleeve) will not be denied by our Brethren, either of the Epiſcopall or Presbyterian judgement, if they be convinced that theſe <hi>Brethren</hi> acted authoritatively in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. (Which I thinke is cleerly proved above.) For no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtian is allowed by them, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> to have right of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative ſuffrage in Eccleſiaſtical Councils.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I have only here againſt me, the Brethren of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational way, who (though from other Scriptures they own the Officers I diſpute for, yet) here ſay, that theſe <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> were the members of the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> Church, as ſuch.
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170420:131"/>But that I humbly conceive cannot be. The <hi>Apoſtles, Elders,</hi> and <hi>Brethren,</hi> v. 23. are the ſame with the whole multitude, <hi>v.</hi> 12. And <hi>the Apoſtles and Elders with the whole Church, v.</hi> 22. Now this <hi>whole Church,</hi> and <hi>whole multitude,</hi> muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther referre <hi>to the whole Church of Jeruſalem,</hi> or to the <hi>whole ſynodical Aſſembly only</hi> of that and other Churches there met together, (which the Reverend Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his book of the Keyes, (<hi>p.</hi> 54, 59.) is pleaſed to call a <hi>Synod of Churches,</hi> or <hi>a Congregation of Churches,</hi> yea <hi>a Church of Churches.</hi>) It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not referre to the <hi>whole Jeruſalem Church,</hi> becauſe neither that whole Church, nor the greater part thereof, could meet in one houſe (much leſs a private houſe, as its probable this was,) to manage the ſynodical affaires orderly; as appeares by the great numbers of that Church recorded upon count, 120, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.15. 3000, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.41. 5000 men, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.4. here are above 8000; and multitudes beſides, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.42. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.7. as is more largely ſhewed by the <hi>London</hi> Miniſters, and moſt excellently by the <hi>Reverend Aſſembly</hi> in their <hi>Anſwer to the Reaſons of the diſſenting Brethren,</hi> where they undoe the Exceptions made againſt it, ſo ſolidly, learned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perſpicuouſly, that they ſeeme to have left no place for a colourable Reply.
